Preface: the scope of the book and how to read it 



This book introduces students to the novel and prose narrative. For the 
most part, it works with case/study readings of novels which are, in my 
experience, widely and frequently taught. They are: Jane Austen's Emma; 
Samuel Richardson's Pamela; Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre; George Eliot's 
Mill on the Floss; Charles Dickens's Bleak House; Henry James's The Spoils 
of Poynton; H.G. Wells's Ann Veronica; Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway; and 
Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children. In other words, they are a selection 
of fictions dating from 1740 to 1980, which are explored in more or less 
chronological succession to illustrate the ways in which the narrative 
strategies of the novel have been subject to both change and continuity over 
the course of two and a half centuries, from the origins of the English novel 
in the eighteenth century to the postmodern and postcolonial novel in the late 
twentieth. In being considered in the final chapter and alongside Midnight's 
Children (1980), Laurence Sterne's eighteenth/century novel Tristram Shandy 
finds itself somewhat out of line: but readers who know anything about 
Sterne's wonderfully anti'linear novel will not be surprised at this. Moreover, 
the anti'linear nature of Sterne's narrative encourages a revised approach to 
the story of the novel in literary history. Generally, each novel is accorded 
its own itemised section (or sections) within a chapter. I have sought to use 
editions which are readily available. 

In Chapter 4 I also demonstrate ways of reading two different kinds 
of short story from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, an 
important transitional period in the history of fiction during which the short 
story became a genre acknowledged in its own right: the stories are Thomas 
Hardy's 'The Withered Arm' and Katherine Mansfield's 'The Garden 
Party'. 

In being concerned with prose narrative as well as the novel, the book

Preface xi 

offers ways of reading non/fictional narratives which are coming to figure 
increasingly in students' programmes as the nature of literary studies itself 
changes. In Chapter 3 I explore ways of reading a nineteenth/century 
autobiography, Samuel Bamford's Early Days, and a nineteenth/century 
biography, Elizabeth Gaskell's The Life of Charlotte Bronte. In selecting these 
narratives, I hope to show how, first, Bamford's autobiography can help 
readers to think about the relationship between writing and class (Bamford 
is generally recognised as a contributor to a tradition of working/class male 
writing). And, secondly, in the case of Elizabeth Gaskell's biography of 
Charlotte Bronte, my aim will be to show how this work can be used in 
discussions of women's writing. 

Of course, judgements are involved in making selections, and selections 
had to be made on the assumption that the average reader's principal study 
needs are still likely to be orientated towards the novel (which as a result 
remains the principal focus of the book). Consequently I should not like 
readers to assume that my readings of non/fictional prose narratives amount 
to a universal code for reading all autobiographies and biographies, different 
examples of which can be found from periods and contexts which, for 
reasons of space, I have not been able to tackle. My readings of non/fiction 
prose narratives offer broad principles to guide reading, backed up by 
examples, and are designed to act as starting points for further study. Of 
course, the same can be said for my readings of novels. Notes which follow 
the chapters point to sources for this further study, and additional infor/ 
mation is provided in the annotated select bibliography. Where material is 
available in easily accessible anthologies and readers I have endeavoured to 
cite from these (whilst seeking also to refer to the original source). 

One of the aims of this book is to provide students with a framework for 
thinking about the relationships between novels and other forms of prose 
narrative, in historical and cultural context, in the light of recent develop/ 
ments in literary studies. In addition, the book provides a basic introduction 
to recent critical positions which have had a major impact on the study 
of the novel, such as feminism, postmodernism and postcolonialism. It is 
important that a book such as this be a synthesis of established positions, 
and, within the bounds of accessibility, as up to date as it can be. As a conse/ 
quence, it has been necessary to venture into some, at times, quite chal/ 
lenging conceptual territory. This is particularly the case in the second 
half of Chapter 1, where I elaborate a critical vocabulary that has emerged 
from the movements known as structuralism and poststructuralism, New 



01 pages i-xii 29/1/03 17:21 Page 



& 



xii Preface 

Historicism and cultural materialism; and in the second half of Chapter 2, 
where I consider debates about the origins of the novel which have been 
conditioned by these movements. 

In the light of this, a word about how to read this book: if during the more 
abstract discussions the reader should happen to find the going tough, move 
on to the more detailed case/study readings in individual chapters, which 
I generally cite after making a conceptual point, and which amount to 
illustrations of the general conceptual point I am making. It could be 
helpful to move around the book, taking advantage of the sections and the 
cross/referencing. Then reread the challenging section. Feel free to make 
choices: if the reader's immediate need is to find out how narrative in the 
novel works in principle and detail, turn to the beginning of Chapter 2 
(where I use Emma as an exemplary novel narrative). 

Literary study without concepts is not an option. Wherever possible I 
have provided definitions of more specialised concepts, such as point of 
view, rhetoric, discourse, intertextuality, the implied reader, and free indirect 
speech, to name but a few. However, it is worth stressing that definitions in 
themselves are of limited use: my definitions are always located in the context 
of an interlocking argument, and this is as important as the definitions.

Introduction: straightforward discourse and 
novel transactions 



1.1 Literature and norvliterature? 

This book is an introduction to the novel and prose narrative as elements of 
literature. 'Literature' is a complex term. It can be used to describe a range 
of linguistic techniques and strategies which generate, for instance, a 
resonant image, or a sense of irony, or purposeful ambiguity, the effects of 
which would lead us to describe the writing which embodied it as 'literary'. 
'Literature' is most often used to signify a valued tradition of writings, 
which is implicitly how it functions when we speak of 'English literature'. 
When I use the term in this work, I by no means reject that meaning: many 
of the works I use to illustrate this study are major contributions to English 
literature which have their status confirmed in the regularity with which 
they are taught in schools, colleges and universities. However, this implies 
that 'English literature' is inseparable from processes of selection, which are 
embedded in structures of power and prestige. So I shall also take note of 
this position, and, consequently, argue against a view of 'literature' which 
assumes that it is a knowable and immutable thing for all times and all 
people. Consequently, novels and prose narratives will have more than one 
relation to different meanings of 'literature'. 

Reading the novel, and to a lesser extent the short story, in their relations 
to different meanings of 'literature' will be my principal focus. But I shall 
also explore the novel in relation to the biography and the autobiography: 
prose narratives which are classified as non/fictional, factual and often 'non/ 
literary', and, yet, which can invite complex responses from readers. If the 
boundaries of 'literature' are, from an historical point of view, never quite 
settled, then 'non/literature' becomes a category which we cannot ignore. 
We will need a rather different kind of critical approach to draw out the full

2 Introduction 

consequences of this point, which will be the overall aim of this intro' 
ductory chapter. To begin with, we should address the problem of prose 
which is, on the face of it, language which is rather less than 'literary'. 

1.2 Prose 

The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) defines prose as 'straightforward 
discourse' or 'the ordinary form of written or spoken language'. The 
ordinariness of prose makes it different from poetic language, which, at its 
most characteristic, is recognisable from the presence of rhyme or metre. 
This ordinariness is a strength from the perspective of communicative 
efficiency and flexibility. Prose is the medium I am writing in now, and it 
could equally be used to introduce readers to the use of computer software: 
'This introductory section of the Microsoft Windows User's Guide provides a 
guide to the documentation ? so you know where to find information about 
working with Windows." But this rather militates against the literary 
credentials of prose, a point recognised by the journalist Andrew Marr 
when reviewing The New Oxford Book of English Prose (1998): 'prose is such 
a general commodity that a real anthology of English prose is unthinkable. 
It would spread too widely, from computer manuals to Sun editorials, and 
would be unreadable.' 2 Marr's comment raises two questions that will 
concern us. The first relates to his sense of prose as a 'general commodity': if 
prose is so ubiquitous, why are certain forms of prose adjudged distinctive? 
The second question raised by Marr is that of readability: if an anthology of 
the totality of English prose would be so inclusive as to be unthinkable, what 
is it that makes some forms of prose more pleasurably readable and thus 
selectable than the variety found in computer manuals? One answer to that 
question must be: narrative. 

1.3 Narrative 

In fact, the majority of anthologised pieces in The New Oxford Book of 
English Prose are from either novels or short stories, forms cast in narrative. In 
1752, the poet and critic Samuel Johnson reflected on why narrative is so 
captivating: 

No Stile of Conversation is more extensively acceptable than the Narrative. 
He who has stored his Memory with slight Anecdotes, private Incidents, and 
personal Particularities, seldom fails to find his Audience favourable. Almost 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



Narrative 3 

every Man listens with Eagerness to contemporary History; perhaps almost every 
Man has some real or imaginary Connection with a celebrated Character, some 
desire to advance, or oppose a rising Name . . . He that is a Hearer in one Place, 
qualifies himself to become a Speaker in another; for though he cannot compre/ 
hend a Series of Argument, or transport the volatile Spirit of Wit without 
Evaporation, yet he thinks himself able to treasure up the various Incidents of a 
Story, and pleases his Hopes with the Information which he shall give to some 
inferior Society. 1 

Skilfully told stories give pleasure to their listeners. As Johnson indicates, 
narrative consists of 'Incidents' or events arranged into a story. These events 
are related by a 'Speaker', or narrator, and they are addressed to a 'Hearer'. 
The popular and non/specialised nature of narrative is evident from the way 
in which 'Hearers' can themselves become 'Speakers' or narrators in turn. 
We will all, at some points in our conversational lives, be narrators in ways 
that will not lead us all to be poets. Johnson reflects on the ordinary, everyday 
status of narrative as a conversational genre ? a genre is a regular (conven/ 
tional) way of speaking or writing ? which highlights similarities between 
this mode of communication and prose. 

This book will explore the workings of written prose narratives which 
relate 'History' in the form of 'private Incidents' acted out in the 'personal 
Peculiarities' of 'Characters' either 'real or imaginary'. For whilst Johnson 
is reflecting on oral narrative, his terms account for the defining charac 
teristics of written narrative genres such as biography and autobiography 
which narrate the lives of 'real' individuals. They also account for the 
'imaginary' representation of characters and their histories in the novel, a 
narrative form which was rising to prominence in England when Johnson 
was writing in the mid eighteenth century (see sections 2.11?14). 

It would be wrong to infer from this that all narrative is popular, conver/ 
sational and prosaic: epic poetry of grand subject matter and sophisticated 
diction such as John Milton's Paradise Lost is woven in the 'volatile Spirit of 
Wit', but is still a narrative. At the same time, narrative does not require 
Milton's epic grandeur to endow it with artistic status. By the end of the 
nineteenth century certain English novels had come to use prose in remark/ 
ably sophisticated ? indeed poetic ? ways which made the ordinary and 
prosaic the basis for distinctive literary art, a theme which will be pursued 
particularly in Chapter 4. The general argument of this book is that it is 
important to see such developments in cultural and historical contexts: in 
sections 4.4?5 I explore the narrative sophistication of Henry James's fiction 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



4 Introduction 

in relation to popular narrative forms such as the late nineteenth/century 
newspaper story. Having said this, we need to acknowledge that placing 
novels and prose narratives in social and historical contexts requires con/ 
siderations which respect the specific characteristics of narrative. 

1.4 Narrative in context: the novel, mimesis and poetics 

Narrative is generally classified as a mimetic medium. 'Mimesis' is a term 
used to describe literary modes which aim to 'imitate' human thoughts, 
speech, action and the world in which they take place: drama and narrative 
would be more readily recognised as mimetic than would lyric poetry. Given 
the mimetic impulses of narrative, and Johnson's recognition of the way in 
which narrative presents us with 'History', it is understandable that students 
expect to study novels and short stories in ways which accentuate their 
relation to the worldly situations which they dramatise. For instance, readers 
may turn to Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre to experience the lot of an orphan 
and governess in the Victorian period. It would appear that such novels 
reflect their historical contexts almost transparently. 

However, approaches to the novel and its contexts which assume that a 
narrative imitates or simply reflects the times in which it was made encounter 
obvious difficulties when confronted by certain narrative strategies. These 
challenging, self-conscious narrative strategies are explored in Chapter 5 
through Laurence Sterne's Tristram Shandy (an eighteenth/century novel), 
John Fowles's The French Lieutenant's Woman, Paul Auster's City of Glass, 
and Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children (twentieth/century novels). These 
narratives playfully expose the limits of mimesis. Although I shall argue that 
even playful, sceptical narrative strategies lead the reader back to worldly 
insights into societies and histories ? in the case of Midnight's Children to 
colonial domination and its resistance ? it will be important to demonstrate 
how these contexts have to be traced through narrative as a complex medium. 
This remains the case even when narratives appear to be transparently 
mimetic. 

If we adopt a basic distinction between the form and content of narrative 
? roughly, content is what a narrative says or is about, form is how it says it ? 
then poetics is a formal mode of literary study based on the systematic 
identification and analysis of the devices and patterns which deliver the 
'how' of a narrative. Poetics is the essential starting point for analysing how 
narratives mediate their effects ? even when that mediation amounts to a 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag? 



Formalism and old and new historicisms 5 

disavowal of narrative's capacity to reflect the world transparently. Sections 
2.1?5 are a reading of Jane Austen's Emma which uses poetics to explain its 
narrative strategies by accounting for the elements of narrative in general, 
such as events, point of view, and character. This will help to explain why 
Emma is viewed as 'literary'. 

But this raises another question: how do we trace social and cultural 
contexts in 'literary' strategies which did not come into the world ready/ 
made, but which were themselves shaped by processes of historical and 
cultural change? These questions will lead us into a debate about the origins 
of the novel as a distinctive literary form developing in conjunction with 
specific social and cultural circumstances in eighteenth/century England. 
This is a literary/critical debate that has been in progress since the 1950s, 
and continues in the present. Sections 2.7?10 will answer these questions 
through a reading of Samuel Richardson's early novel Pamela which will be 
framed by the questions: what do we mean by a novel? Which genres and 
writing techniques were drawn together to produce it? As we shall see, 
Pamela is based on the familiar letter and the journal. A cultural and critical 
debate about literacy and the making of the self in the mid eighteenth 
century will be traced through the distinctive way in which Richardson's 
Pamela transforms these genres into a special kind of narrative. 

1.5 The novel and prose narrative in literary /critical 
argument: formalism and old and new historicisms 

This brings us to the importance of literary/critical argument. Writers of 
novels often wrote critically and reflectively about the narrative strategies they 
were shaping, a point that will be demonstrated in connection with Samuel 
Richardson and Henry Fielding in section 2.10; George Eliot in 3.12; and 
Henry James, H. G. Wells and Virginia Woolf in 4.7 and 4.14. Moreover, 
since the nineteenth century, novels have been reviewed and judged in 
literary periodicals (sections 3.4 and 3.7 will explore examples of these). 
These practices link the novel to the academic literary criticism which has 
been practised on the form for around one hundred years: it demonstrates 
that the nature of narrative was actively debated and analysed in its own 
time. 

Whilst there are continuities between the critical writings of practising 
novelists of the past and more recent forms of literary criticism, it is also 
necessary to be alert to differences. The main difference is that, since the end

6 Introduction 

of the nineteenth century, the novel has become a major object of academic 
study in schools and higher education, viewed as an embodiment of literary 
and artistic tradition. This was not necessarily the function it was 'born' 
to, or a reliable index of the esteem in which it has sometimes been held, as 
this chapter will later suggest. Nonetheless, in becoming a major object of 
literary and artistic tradition, increasingly sophisticated varieties of literary 
criticism have been developed to validate this view of the novel. 

Literary criticism is a powerful shaping force in the study of literature, 
which has played, and continues to play, a central role in selecting what we 
read and how we read it. The initial forms of academic novel criticism to be 
formulated in the later nineteenth century were orientated towards historical 
study, in line with the general way in which English literature ? a university 
discipline that barely existed before the end of the nineteenth century ? was 
studied at that time. This approach emphasised the relationship between 
philology (the history of the language), the history of genre, and authorial 
genius in shaping a national literary tradition. Subsequently, the dominant 
modes of twentieth/century novel criticism have taken poetics as their 
orientation, emphasising the formal complexity of the novel (formalist 
approaches will be differentiated and discussed in more detail in sections 
2.1-5). 

Formalist approaches have generated rich insights, but also some draw/ 
backs. In making distinctions between literary and non/literary narrative 
strategies ? by, for instance, foregrounding the complexity of point of view 
in the novel ? formal approaches have commented richly on a selection of 
important novels whilst remaining relatively silent on non/fictional prose 
narratives such as biography and autobiography. Consequently these formal 
approaches to the novel have offered only limited insight into the wider 
literary and cultural significance of prose narrative. 

Biography and autobiography are complex narratives which can in/ 
vite readers to think again about what we mean by 'literature'. Victorian 
examples of these prose narratives are a major focus of sections 3.8?11, 
where I offer ways of reading Elizabeth Gaskell's The Life of Charlotte 
Bronte, and the working/class autodidact Samuel Bamford's autobiographi/ 
cal Early Days. My approach to narrative is framed by a style of new literary/ 
historical reading which looks for literariness in the supposedly non/literary, 
and the non/literary in literature. Such an approach can be aligned with 
such movements as poststructuralism, the New Historicism, and cultural 
materialism (as well as their feminist and postcolonial inflections): move/

Historicism, culture and rhetoric 7 

merits which have developed out of recent theoretical approaches to literary 
study/ The remainder of this chapter will provide a basic outline of the 
conceptual vocabulary which supports a new literary/historical approach, 
along with a discussion of its significance. The concepts of rhetoric, 
intertextuality, discourse and culture can provide readers with new ways of 
making literary/critical connections between novels and non/fictional 
narrative forms. At a deeper level they provide us with new ways of re 
thinking the historically shifting relations between literary and non/literary 
writings as practices which are embedded in cultural and social relations. 

Of course, new literary/historical approaches are not entirely new: one of 
the striking things about the conceptual vocabulary that will play a role in 
the more integrated approach to the novel and prose narrative I advocate is 
that an earlier version of it can be found at work in the 'old' historicism, 
which organised literary criticism prior to the ascendancy of formalism. We 
can observe this by returning to one of the first textbooks designed to 
introduce students to the study of the novel, in order to measure the simi/ 
larities and differences between 'old' and 'new' historicisms. 



1.6 Studying the novel and prose narrative: historicism, 
culture and rhetoric 

Selden L. Whitcomb's The Study of a Novel, published in 1906 when the 
author was an associate professor of English literature at the University of 
Kansas, addressed the first generation of students to study the novel as an 
academic exercise. Whitcomb's approach was historicist in the sense that he 
saw the development of the novel running parallel to and reflecting the grand 
historical progress of civilisation: 'Every great movement in the history of 
fiction, though modified by race and nationality, is one phase of a general 
cultural episode in modern civilisation." Whitcomb clearly understood 
'modernity' to be a process of change and transformation, and his evidence 
for the novel's links to this progressive movement were to be found in such 
grand constructs as civilisation, the race, the nation and culture. 'Culture', 
as Raymond Williams has pointed out, is a complex word with a wide sem/ 
antic range, and we will encounter its different past and present meanings in 
what remains of this chapter. 6 

To begin with, Whitcomb supposes that the progress of civilisation is 
reflected in novels which, when taken together, constitute a major 'cultural 
episode' in that process. This was because the novel, for Whitcomb, reflected

8 Introduction 

'cultural life in general'. For Whitcomb, 'culture' shaped the specificities of 
race and nation, and the mimetic capabilities of the novel 'give one a more 
extensive picture of social culture than any other form of art' (p. 138). In 
making this claim he brought 'culture' and 'society' together in a way which 
was characteristic of nineteenth/century thought. Societies were conceived 
as historically developing organisms, made up of varied yet interdependent 
social classes and groupings. What distinguished these societies from one 
another was the distinctive pattern of 'culture' by which such societies lived, 
the term here embracing knowledge, belief, law, morals and customs. In this 
sense 'culture' was conceived anthropologically as a whole way of life 
(the impact of this conception of culture on George Eliot's novels will be 
examined in section 3.12). Not only could the novel reflect culture, it was 
formed from the expressive essence of culture: Whitcomb noted that the 
novel's 'medium of expression, language ... must always suggest some 
special type of cultural life' (p. 138). This was to be found in a detailed study 
of the novel, and his textbook opened with a close analysis of its distinctive 
narrative structures (events, episodes, story, plot, character, point of view) 
and their artistic effects. To this extent, Whitcomb's cultural historicism 
depended on formal analysis. Yet, he approached the question of form from 
a specific perspective. 

Whitcomb wrote from the perspective of an American university system 
which placed a strong emphasis on 'comparative rhetoric' and composition 
(p. 218). Rhetoric is a discipline with ancient roots, concerned with 
analysing the construction of oral and written compositions in order to 
maximise their persuasive and affective powers on their intended addressees. 
Clearly rhetoric has a practical aim to advise writers on good, and not so 
good, ways of writing. Whitcomb's book regularly suggests compositional 
exercises which will assist in clarifying the rhetorical effects of particular 
modes of writing: Assuming that Silas Marner [in George Eliot's novel of 
1860] was a real individual, recast the novel into the form of a biography' 
(p. 225). This is something that I put into practice, albeit on a less ambitious 
scale, when I rewrite passages of narrative in sections 2.2 and 4.12 to assess 
the workings of the originals. In section 3.10 I focus specifically on 
biography as a distinctively rhetorical form of writing. 

The approach I adopt towards biography urges an appreciation of rhetoric 
as a significant critical tool with much broader implications. Formalist novel 
criticism in the twentieth century has, with some exceptions, 7 tended to 
neglect the role of rhetoric. But in the last decades of the twentieth century

From 'literature' to 'intertextuality' 9 

critics have rediscovered rhetoric, because it enables critical and analytical 
insight into the social and historical contexts within which particular forms 
of narrative have aspired to be persuasive and powerful. There are two 
consequences which follow from this: first, rhetoric encourages readers 
of narrative to widen their horizons beyond the novel, and to look at the 
workings of the novel in relation to other kinds of narrative (and non/ 
narrative) material ? I'll explore this in the following sections. Secondly, if 
we remember that rhetoric has a persuasive aim, then a rhetorical approach 
to narratives can highlight the way in which narratives have entered into 
contests to secure the attention of readers, or tell the truth from particular 
perspectives. Rhetoric can be seen as an index of the struggles that divide, 
fracture and fragment the historical process along the lines of gender, class 
and race. I'll explore these in more detail in the following sections: they will 
lead us to an accordingly modified understanding of 'culture'. 

1.7 The novel and prose narrative: from 'literature' to 
'intertextuality' 

A defining feature of the novel is that it does not belong to any single genre, 
yet participates in all genres. Whitcomb's rhetorical approach to the novel 
acknowledges its borrowings from the conventions which distinguish other 
literary modes and prose genres. For instance, Whitcomb suggests that 
'students of the novel might profit by plot analysis of [Thomas] Carlyle's 
French Revolution', a colourful and dramatic work of history published in 
1837 (p. 48). Thus Whitcomb saw the novel as a 'complex, composite ... 
type' (p. 218) which was made up from 'literature itself. 

By 'literature' Whitcomb meant a vast field in which writings and generic 
conventions circulated. It included drama, which provided conventions for 
representing the speech, thought and action of characters. It also included 
the prose genres of the narrative history (such as Carlyle's French Revolution), 
which provided models for plotting the passage of time and processes of 
social change and continuity. The prose genre of documentary reportage 
provided models for writing about the observation of social life and manners 
on which the 'realistic' effects of novels often depend (different critical 
accounts of 'realism' will be traced in sections 2.12 and 3.12). The bio/ 
graphy provided models for narrating the life/course of individual characters. 
Finally the essay provided models for narrative commentary and discussion 
(p. 171).

10 Introduction 

Whitcomb's approach to the derivativeness of the novel anticipates 
present/day approaches to what have come to be known as the 'inter/ 
textualities' of narrative. These approaches are premised on understanding 
narrative as 'text', that is to say a tissue of interwoven writings. Thus 
'intertextuality' is a concept which seeks to grasp the fact that a novel 'is not 
a self-contained, individually authored whole, but the absorption and 
transformation of other texts'. 8 The intertextualities of the novel and prose 
narrative will be a consistent focus of my approach, especially in Chapter 2, 
where I consider the eighteenth/century origins of the novel; Chapter 3, 
which considers the relation of the Victorian novel to contemporary bio/ 
graphical and autobiographical narratives; and Chapter 5, which explores 
the complex intertextualities of late twentieth/century postmodern and post/ 
colonial fictions (the absorption and transformation of Laurence Sterne's 
parodic eighteenth/century novel Tristram Shandy in Salman Rushdie's 
Midnight's Children in particular). In thinking about the significance of 
intertextuality, it is necessary to make links with the concept of discourse, 
and broader trends in present/day literary theory. 

1.8 The novel and prose narrative as 'forms of discourse' 

Whitcomb's approach addressed the different 'forms of discourse' that are 
woven together in the novel (p. 218). 'Discourse' is a term which links 
Whitcomb's book to present/day theoretical concerns, though in consider/ 
ing these we shall need to trace some shifts in its meaning. 'Discourse' derives 
from the Latin discursus, which means to run to and fro: the OED tells us 
that some of the earliest sixteenth/century usages in English employ the term 
to describe, for example, the movements of the sun during its daily course 
across the sky. At around about the same time, 'discourse' was also being 
used to classify any spoken or written treatment of a subject. For Whitcomb 
'discourse' describes an approach to the analysis of a novel's composite 
textual structure as it goes to and fro between a variety of genres, their 
linguistic conventions and implied social contexts. Late twentieth/century 
theoretical approaches to novel and narrative criticism continue to invoke 
'discourse' in this sense. At the same time they have gone further in using the 
term to probe the linguistic, social and power relations that are embedded in 
a narrative's absorption of 'discourses'. 

It is beyond the scope of this book to provide a detailed introduction to the 
terrain of literary theory which has transformed literary study in Britain

'Forms of discourse' 11 

since the mid 1970s. 9 It is possible to outline a general sense of the way in 
which it has transformed an understanding of the orientation of language in 
general, which has, in turn, had major implications for the language of the 
novel and prose narrative. The initial impetus for the turn to theory derived 
from Ferdinand de Saussure's early twentieth/century linguistics and its 
adoption by the continental European structuralist and semiotic movement 
of the 1950s and 1960s ('semiotics' is the study of signs). 

What did Saussure and structuralism challenge? Selden Whitcomb 
wrote his 1906 guide to the novel in an intellectual climate which recognised 
language as a rhetorical medium, but a medium which individuals could 
freely use to refer to and express the things of the world, human states 
of mind, emotions and so forth. This made language an intelligible fact of 
nature. Whitcomb accepted that writers would struggle with the imperfec 
tions of language in an effort to express their 'ideas and ideals'; but in the end 
they 'may take delight in calm obedience to the will of nature, as it appears 
in ... language' (p. 248). 

In a radical departure, Saussure's linguistics argued that language does 
not work on the basis of nature, reference and expression. Instead, it works 
on the basis of convention, signification and difference. Saussure no longer 
started with a conception of the word, conceiving instead of the 'sign', 
arguing that signs generate meaning not because they refer to things; 
on the contrary, they have a completely arbitrary relationship to things. 
Signs generate meaning because of conventionally maintained relations of 
difference from one another within a self-contained structure ('la langue', 
or language). 10 This powerful, self-contained structure is something that 
humans are born into: language speaks, or writes, its users, rather than the 
other way round. In practice, this structural and semiotic theory of language 
breaks the natural 'fit' between language and the world which was always a 
possibility for pre/structuralist novel criticism. For the novel and narrative, 
this break means that its mimetic effects have to be seen as being derived from 
signification rather than reference and expression. If the novel imitates at all 
then it imitates the conventions of signification which structure language as 
a practice. Instead of imitating the things of the world, the novel imitates 
language structures. 

These arguments have been extended by certain present/day theories of 
'discourse'. One of the difficulties with Saussure's structuralist theory of 
language is that 'la langue' is assumed to be homogeneous and smoothly self- 
regulating. This is where theories of 'discourse' take Saussure's insights in 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



12 Introduction 

directions which theorise language as a field fractured by complex social and 
historical conflicts." Poststructuralist discourse theorists argue that 'la 
langue' is really an array of discursive practices, or specific domains of 
speaking and writing, which authorise and regulate social life and power 
relations. 

Poststructuralist critics have started to reread the novel in history in the 
light of discourse theory. Nancy Armstrong has argued that manners and 
morals of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were institutionalised in 
the discourse of domesticity, which became the object of Richardson's novel 
Pamela (see section 2.14). Discursive practices also authorise and regulate 
recognisably institutionalised knowledges, such as religion, philosophy, the 
law, medicine and science. These can be equally important to the novel: the 
authority of the discourse of scientific 'biology', which emerged only in the 
nineteenth century, is used decisively in H. G. Wells's novel Ann Veronica 
(1909) (see section 4.8). Over time the status, internal composition and 
relations between discourses change. Nancy Armstrong's reading of Pamela 
argues that its discourses of domesticity and sexual desire acquired con/ 
siderable authority and power in the middle of the eighteenth century. By 
the time of H. G. Wells's novel, domesticity could no longer be assigned 
such authority (Wells's heroine has to escape its stifling suburban mani/ 
festation). In Wells's novel biology is the master discourse which assumes 
authority over the messy conflict waged between other competing social 
and political discourses, which the narrative dramatises through character 
types. 

Discourses 'make' characters in novels and in life: they do this by marking 
out particular positions ? so/called subject positions ? from which indi' 
vidual subjects and collective interests can fashion identities. Accordingly, 
discourses construct evaluations of individual identity based on the social 
categories of masculinity and femininity (gender), class and social rank, and 
race and ethnicity. This is a particularly important point for the new literary/ 
historical rationale in constructing links between novels, biographies and 
autobiographies. These emerged as important genres for absorbing and trans/ 
forming discourses of subjectivity to articulate what Dipesh Chakrabarty 
has described as 'the public and private rituals of modern individualism'. 12 
I noted in my brief discussion of Saussure that one of the implications of his 
theory of language is that language 'makes' the self. 'Literature' can be 
viewed as a discourse which can be drawn upon in these rituals of self- 
making. If we take 'literature' to be present in specific, prestigious uses of

The novel and 'culture' revisited 13 

language, we will see how the Victorian working/class writer Samuel 
Bamford uses 'literary' discourse in his autobiography to fashion an image of 
himself as a 'cultured' individual (see section 3.9). 



1.9 The novel and 'culture' revisited: 'culture' as learning, 
'self-culture', 'culture' as a field of conflict 

Whitcomb's book was aimed at the first generation of students who were 
beginning to study the novel as 'literature'. This brings us to another sense 
of the novel's relationship to 'culture' which is implicit in Whitcomb's 
project: 'culture' as the learned study of selected and valued objects which 
could promote the moral and intellectual growth of an individual reader in 
'self-culture'. As I shall demonstrate in Chapters 2 and 3, novels such as 
Richardson's Pamela and Bronte's Jane Eyre told powerful stories about selves 
which were expected to enrich their readers morally. And yet, a certain 
defensiveness in Whitcomb's tone indicates the difficulty he faced when 
installing the novel in general as a valued and self-improving object of study: 
'it is no longer deemed necessary to apologise for fiction itself, but a detailed 
study of its form is still quite generally proposed in apologetic tones' (p. vii). 
Whitcomb's comment recognises the novel's quasi'disreputable past during 
which it had, in some incarnations, been vilified as trivial or downright 
harmful to processes of 'self-culture'. 

Let us look at what was at stake in two examples of ways in which the 
novel was seen to be harmful to 'self-culture'. Because novels are classified 
as fictions or made/up stories, and because certain Protestant theologies are 
distrustful of imitations and images, novels were anathema to some religious 
sects, especially during the nineteenth century. However, the same sects still 
subscribed to the benefits of 'self-culture' through approved forms of read/ 
ing. If novels were rejected, biographies and autobiographies ? non/fictional 
narratives about 'real', exemplary individual lives ? were considered to 
be suitable. 13 Another example of the novel's perceived harmfulness was 
articulated supposedly in defence of women readers of novels in the nine/ 
teenth century, whose 'weaker minds' were deemed, in the gendered dis' 
courses of biological and psychological science, to be more susceptible to 
damage under the influence of sensationally shocking narratives. 14 The 
point to note about these examples of attempts to regulate the relations 
between the novel and 'self-culture' is that they judge the novel through, 
on the one hand, discourses of theology and its distinctions between 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



14 Introduction 

divine truth and devious fiction; and, on the other, gendered science and 
psychology. 

This brings us to the least immediately obvious, yet most important sense 
of the relation of the novel and prose narrative to 'culture'. This defines 
'culture' as a field, actualised in print and book production, in which 
meanings are made and exchanged, and discourses clash and collide over 
contests between, for instance, the real and the fictional, high and low taste, 
convention and originality, and masculine and feminine identities. Novels 
can be open to challenge in this field by authoritative discourses which 
dismiss them as trivial or harmful. But novels can selectively absorb those 
authoritative discourses into their intertexts, as we shall see in Jane Eyre's use 
of psychological discourse (section 3.5). Novels can also, as we shall see in 
sections 4.4?5, aspire to the higher echelons of the field by refining 
themselves into serious mediators of a refined artistic perspective on life. Or, 
indeed, novels can adopt a playful and parodic orientation towards cultural 
discourses (Chapter 5). Thus novels in England have been, since the 
eighteenth century at least, important participants in the field of culture, 
absorbing discourses into their narrative intertexts which rehearse and seek 
to resolve conflicts over contested values and meanings. 

This way of seeing the novel needs to be blended with the very factors that 
grant novels their privileged position in the cultural field, which is based on 
the subjective investments and involvements that they invite of their readers. 
Novels engagingly dramatise conflicts over truth and value through stories 
about character formation and relationships in recognisable social settings, 
where the everyday materials of manners, morals, customs and beliefs seem 
to be like life itself. In other words, readers can generally seek the pleasurable 
surface presence of a mimetic 'picture of social culture', to use Whitcomb's 
words again. But this is an effect, an artfully constructed alibi to deflect from 
the contest of discourses that is being waged. 

But the contest is never deflected completely. Certain narratives, for 
instance those I shall address in Chapter 5, insist that the reader recognises 
them for what they are: narrative discourses. And even in more transparent 
reading experiences, readers are often invited to negotiate complex linguistic 
or indeed 'literary' effects. Whitcomb noted that 'the interpretation of 
culture by the novelist often has a touch of irony, for the imagination sees 
manners in their relative values' (p. 138). Whitcomb recognised, import/ 
antly, that novelists can be active and critical interpreters of that which they 
represent, as is evident in the degree of ironic distance perceptible in even 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



Notes 15 

the clearest picture of manners or morals. If we remember that discourse 
signifies in order to produce the effect of mimesis, it follows that irony in the 
novel is produced by linguistic means; that is to say, the imitation and ironic 
framing or 'quoting' of voices and forms of discourse. This is a point that I 
shall demonstrate in section 2.6, when I analyse the narrative techniques of 
free indirect speech in Jane Austen's Emma; and section 4.2, where I analyse 
'language images' in Charles Dickens's Bleak House. Both techniques invite 
complex literary responses, but the general point to emphasise is that these 
are shaped by the discursive contexts, and conflicts of culture, in which the 
novels participate. 

For Selden Whitcomb the development of the novel in history coincided 
with periods of conflict: 'the novel has flourished most in periods of 
complex social life, when antagonistic currents of thought were meeting, 
giving rise to social, ethical and aesthetic problems' (p. 160). To that extent 
Whitcomb's view of the novel is close to that which has been formulated by 
an important twentieth/century Russian theorist and historian of the novel, 
M. M. Bakhtin. Bakhtin's view of the history of the novel will be discussed 
in more detail in section 5.6. Broadly, he conceived the novel as a dynamic 
form in continuous and active dialogue with the forms of language and 
discourse which struggled against one another at particular moments of 
social and cultural history." The main difference between Whitcomb and 
Bakhtin, and other present/day critics who have moved broadly in line with 
the new literary/historicism, is this: for Whitcomb the novel was a reflection 
of social change and conflict, whereas for critics in the present the discursive 
intertexts of the novel and prose narrative are seen as active participants in 
shaping and negotiating these cultural conflicts ? sources of power in their 
own right.

The elements of narrative analysis and the origins 
of the novel: reading Jane Austen's Emma and 
Samuel Richardson's Pamela 



2.1 The novel and formalist criticism 

Jane Austen's Emma announced itself to readers in the following terms 
when it was published in 1816: EMMA: / A NOVEL / IN 
THREE VOLUMES / BY THE AUTHOR OF 'PRIDE AND 
PREJUDICE'. 1 This suggests a number of 'givens': that 'the novel' was an 
identifiable cultural institution, recognised by 'novel' readers; that certain 
authors were 'novelists' to whom readers would return because of prior 
performances (Jane Austen is not named, instead there is a reference to the 
earlier Pride and Prejudice); that readers would find a continuous narrative 
in the three separate volumes comprising the work. Two years before in a 
postscript to his novel Waverley (1814, published anonymously), Sir Walter 
Scott was able to write confidently of a 'contract' between reader and 
novelist. 2 If all of this points to the existence of a stable and knowing 
relationship between novelists and readers in the first decades of the 
nineteenth century, why is it that Percy Lubbock, over one hundred years 
later in 1921, should complain in an influential book entitled The Craft of 
Fiction of 'the want of a received nomenclature', or vocabulary, for the 
purpose of 'criticising the craft of fiction'? 3 

Lubbock's sense of a lack can be explained by the fact that he was 
'inventing' a formalist novel criticism. Novel reading might be founded on 
an implicit contract, but criticism had to be explicit and precise. Lubbock's 
own preference for a critical vocabulary, centred on the question of narrative 
point of view, was derived rather selectively from his mentor Henry James, 
a late nineteenth/century novelist and critic whose legacy will be examined 
in sections 4.5?7. Lubbock argued that the novel, in order to be considered 
as good art, ought to be unified around a consistent narrative point of view 
(a concept which will be explored in section 2.5 below). 

17 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



18 The elements of narrative analysis 

In claiming that there was no received vocabulary, there is a sense in which 
Lubbock was overlooking the intellectual past he could have built upon. 4 
For instance, when John Colin Dunlop published his monumental History 
of Prose Fiction in 1814 (the same year as Waverley), he was attentive to what 
he called 'disposition', or narrative method, and, accordingly, to the fact that 
any explicatory summary would edit out the 'style and sentiments', or formal 
details, that made the way in which a 'subject' was treated in narrative 
distinctive. 5 

Dunlop approached his subject historically; he was interested in the 
'genesis and genealogy of fiction'. Lubbock's approach consciously 
swerved away from the problems of historical and cultural difference, 
and his invention of ahistorical, formalist criticism inaugurated a particular 
tradition of critical reading. 7 This has developed into an important approach 
to reading the novel. In the first part of this chapter, I shall look at the way 
in which this tradition can help readers to appreciate the narrative distinc 
tiveness of Austen's Emma, a text that knew itself to be a novel. In addition 
to Lubbock I shall consider the work of Wayne C. Booth, Seymour 
Chatman and Shlomith Rimmon/Kenan. 8 

At the same time it is worth highlighting a sceptical note that Lubbock 
strikes when he observes that 'the literary critic, with nothing to point to but 
the mere volume in his hand, must recognize that his wish to be precise, to 
be definite, to be clear and exact in his statements, is hopelessly vain." In one 
sense, Lubbock conceived this as a state of affairs that his own approach 
would begin to rectify. However, as I will argue, something confirming the 
vanity of longed'for critical precision is manifest in the way that vocabulary 
is not at all settled between formalist critics themselves. 

Lubbock's sceptical point raises an even more searching question: what 
kind of an object are we studying when we read a novel? According to 
Lubbock's way of reading, our task is to analyse singular works of narrative 
art. But it may be that we need to think about that seemingly autonomous 
text intertextually: that is to say, as a text which has absorbed and trans/ 
formed other texts and discourses (see section 1.7). This will involve us 
in having to think differently about the construction of that category, 'the 
novel', which seems so settled from our hitherto limited exploration of 
Austen and Scott. The second half of this chapter will explore these 
questions in relation to Samuel Richardson's Pamela (1740) and other works 
which figure in the debate about the rise of the novel. This will involve a shift 
from one style of critical discussion to another: the chapter will begin with

Reading the form of narrative fiction 19 

close reading, but will use this as a basis for a move to, first, more historical 
and then theoretical styles of discussion. The end of the chapter will return 
to Emma again to reconsider Austen's text in the new light shed by these 
styles of discussion. 

2.2 Reading the form of narrative fiction: 
Jane Austen's Emma 

In The Craft of Fiction Lubbock distinguished between stories which 'tell' 
their readers what to think, and stories which 'show' their readers actions or 
thoughts which invite the reader to make judgements on the basis of more 
active processes of sense/making and interpretation. He held the latter to be 
more artistically coherent and satisfying. 

First, 'telling': in the opening paragraphs of Emma, the relationship 
between Emma and her governess Miss Taylor is described in the following 
way: 'the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they had been 
living together as friend and friend very mutually attached, and Emma 
doing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgement, but 
directed chiefly by her own' (p. 37). Here, the reader is told what to think 
about their relationship and Emma's tendency to do as she likes. 

What if Jane Austen were to have written this in a different way? The 
effect of 'showing' can be assessed through experimental rewriting: 

Emma looked at her friend and could recall a distant time when it had been Miss 
Taylor's duty to exercise authority; Emma esteemed Miss Taylor's judgement as 
the very source of her own ability to discriminate confidently and act decisively 
in ways which, strangely, were often contrary to her former governess's. 

This is angled more from Emma's perspective: although it is still written in 
the grammatical third person, Emma is realised as a dramatised centre of 
consciousness ? the reader is in touch with her thoughts ? confirmed by 
the way in which we seem to 'hear' something of the surprise in her voice 
('strangely') from which we infer a lack of self-awareness. The reader comes 
to the same conclusion about the Emma? Miss Taylor relationship, and 
about Emma's forthright and excessive self-confidence which leads her to do 
what she wants: but the judgement is based on something that the reader has 
been 'shown' rather than told. 

Lubbock's distinction between 'showing' and 'telling' is a useful intro> 
duction to some of the major issues that have preoccupied formalist critics of

20 The elements of narrative analysis 

the novel. At the same time, later critics have found it wanting. In 1961 
Wayne C. Booth pointed out in The Rhetoric of Fiction that it was unwise to 
rate 'showing' above 'telling' because the distinction was 'arbitary', in the 
sense that narrative is always told from some source or other. Rejecting 
Lubbock's concern with narrative unity and consistent 'method', Booth 
was more interested in the 'many voices' that an author uses to tell a tale 
effectively. 10 But a grasp of the way in which these 'many voices' are ordered 
requires a more detailed and elaborate account of narrative than Lubbock 
offered. 

In his book Story and Discourse (1978), Seymour Chatman devised a 
model for anatomising the formal elements and relations of narrative; it 
aimed to provide the critical reader with a framework for identifying the 
'many voices' and levels of meaning production at work in a narrative: 

real author... > (implied author > narrator > narratee > implied reader) 
. . . > real reader 

The elements within the parentheses ( ) are the most important aspects of 
this model. Thus, the activities of the real author and the real reader are 
constrained by a set of formal relations which are internal to the narrative. 
These internal relations will guide our reading of Emma, helping the real 
reader to identify, for example, when the implied reader is invited by 
the narrator to read some aspect of the story ? received opinion, character 
speech, thoughts or actions ? ironically. The model will also help to 
highlight some of the major terminological and conceptual differences 
between critics who have developed the formal approach. For although 
Chatman concluded his work by defending the precision, integrity and 
inclusiveness of his model, in practice critics have continued to argue about 
his terminology and categories, which would seem to confirm Lubbock's 
lurking scepticism about the quest for precision in vocabulary. 12 

Before embarking on a close analysis of the opening paragraphs of Emma 
? which will in turn lead us to ways of thinking about events, charac 
terisation and point of view ? we need to say an introductory word about 
the concept of the implied reader. An addressee is a rhetorical feature of all 
written discourse. In mentioning the 'critical reader' in the paragraph pre/ 
ceding Chatman's model, the discourse of this book inscribes the sort of 
reader who is implied by the development of its argument and choice 
of examples: someone who wants, or needs, to become skilled as a critical 
reader of the novel and prose narrative. The concept of the implied reader

draws attention to the fact that any writing, whether imaginative or critical, 
is addressed to a reader who is assumed to have, temporarily at least, an 
investment in the means and ends of that writing. According to Wayne C. 
Booth in his classic account of the rhetorical means and persuasive ends of 
fictional narrative, and in which he devoted a substantial portion to the 
technical feats of Emma, control of the reader is the goal." 

2.3 Implied reader, real reader: narrator, implied author 

The pact that is established between a narrative discourse and the reader 
implied in that discourse is central to effective fictional prose narrative. As 
you will see from Chatman's diagram, this pact has to be located in relation 
to the narrator, who imparts to the reader the 'contents' of the story: the 
events, the locations in which they unfold, and the characters affected. We 
can look now at the opening of Emma in full: 

Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and 
happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and 
had lived nearly twentyone years in the world with very little to distress or vex 
her. 

She was the youngest of two daughters of a most affectionate, indulgent 
father, and had, in consequence of her sister's marriage, been mistress of his 
house from a very early period. Her mother had died too long ago for her to have 
more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses, and her place had been 
supplied by an excellent woman as governess, who had fallen little short of a 
mother in affection. 

Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr Woodhouse's family, less as a 
governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly of Emma. 
Between them it was more the intimacy of sisters. Even before Miss Taylor had 
ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, the mildness of her temper had 
hardly allowed her to impose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being 
long now passed away, they had been living as friend and friend very mutually 
attached, and Emma doing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor's 
judgement, but directed chiefly by her own. 

The real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of having rather 
too much her own way, and a disposition to think too well of herself; these were 
the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments. The danger, 
however, was so unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes 
with her. 

Sorrow came ? a gentle sorrow ? but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable 
consciousness. ? Miss Taylor married. It was Miss Taylor's loss which first 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



22 The elements of narrative analysis 

brought grief. It was on the wedding day of this beloved friend that Emma first 
sat in mournful thought of any continuance. The wedding over and the bride/ 
people gone, her father and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect of 
a third to cheer the long evening, (p. 37) 

The reader implied here by the third/person narrator's opening description 
of Emma Woodhouse values good looks, cleverness, wealth and domestic 
comfort. The real reader ? you, situated at a different point in history 
possessed of, in all probability, somewhat different social horizons to the 
implied reader of 1816 ? may value these less than other things. But to read 
the novel appropriately, the real reader enters into the position of the implied 
reader. Actually, the implied reader is invited to look beyond these values by 
appreciating, at relevant points, a tone of playfulness and irony which 
relativises this limited scale of values in relation to wider, more generous 
possibilities. This tone is conveyed by the functions of the narrator in the 
use of words such as 'seemed'. The fact that Emma 'seemed to unite some of 
the best blessings of existence' implies a distance between appearance and 
reality. In discussing the role of the narrator as the authoritative and ironising 
source of the story, we shall also need to think about the role that is 
sometimes played by an 'implied author'. 

The first point to make about the implied author is that it is a function 
which needs to be distinguished from the real author, Jane Austen. Wayne 
C. Booth has gone so far as to argue that the implied author is the real 
author's 'second self, though the idea of an authoritative 'shadow' function 
to the narrator is of more practical use in analysis. 11 An implied author as 
'shadow' is most evident in narratives where we follow the guidance of a 
dramatised, unreliable narrator; that is to say a first/person narrator of 
limited understanding who has to some degree participated in the story 
being told. Thus in Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights (1847), it is clear that 
Mr Lockwood's narration of the situation he walks into at the Heights is not 
reliable: his evaluation of Heathcliff as a 'capital fellow!' sits uneasily with 
Heathcliff's 'suspicious' and 'jealous' disposition. 15 It is as though there is, 
as the source of the latter adjectives, a 'shadow' function which, to correct 
Lockwood's effusive and unknowing dramatised first/person narration, 
'establishes norms for the work', in Seymour Chatman's phrase." 

Shlomith Rimmon/Kenan is sceptical about the need to find an implied 
author in all narratives. Rimmon/Kenan prefers to distinguish between 
'forms and degrees of perceptibility of the narrator in the text'. 17 In Emma the 
third/person narrator is highly perceptible, and explicitly involved in the 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



Events: story and discourse 23 

process of establishing 'norms', so here the function of narrator and implied 
author have merged. In Emma the narrator moves between statements which 
invite inference, and statements which didactically state the conclusion 
which the implied reader has been invited to draw. As we have already seen, 
at the end of the third paragraph the narrator observes that Emma esteems 
Miss Taylor's judgement whilst she follows her own. Just in case the reader 
has missed the point the narrator then states the 'real evils' of Emma's 
situation: that the young Emma has had too much her own way, and that 
restraining authority has been absent from her upbringing. The norm that is 
established in these opening paragraphs is that individual judgement needs 
to be checked by a more sagacious authority. We might add that the third/ 
person narrative voice is precisely the authority that Emma has been deprived 
of through the negligible presence of a self-absorbed father and a friend 
rather than a governess. 

In addition to establishing 'norms', the narrator of Emma also performs 
the function which in some narratives may be performed by the implied 
author: that is, 'stacking the cards', to borrow again from Chatman. By this, 
Chatman means the function of shaping and clarifying the implied reader's 
dramatic expectations in the deployment of strategic words such as 'un/ 
perceived'. The 'danger ... at present ... unperceived' points to a reversal 
not glimpsed by Emma, but which is now anticipated by the implied reader. 
The narrator in Emma establishes norms and stimulates an appetite for narra/ 
tive and the events that it organises. According to this model, the implied 
reader is at least as enthralled by the pleasures of narrative anticipation as by 
morals and values. 

2.4 Events: story and discourse 

This brings us to a consideration of events. Without events, there could be 
no story for the reader to anticipate and follow. Rimmon/Kenan defines an 
event as, quite simply, something that happens and that can be summed up 
by a verb or the name of an occurrence. 18 The whole enterprise of ordering 
and making sense of events is made pleasurable and challenging by the fact 
that, contrary to superficial appearances, events in a narrative discourse are 
seldom presented to us in strict chronological order. An example from the 
first paragraph of Emma would be that in the narrator's recounting of events 
relevant to Emma's early life, we find out about Emma's sister's marriage 
before we are told of the death of the sisters' mother, though the latter is, 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



24 The elements of narrative analysis 

chronologically, the prior event. Thus our conventional sense of time and 
sequence leads us to wish to reorder events. In making sense of events, the 
implied reader keeps moving between, to borrow terms from Chatman, the 
'what' of the 'story' (the events comprising the story sequentially arranged) 
and the 'how' of the 'discourse' (their manner of being narrated). 

The passage above ends with the event which inaugurates the main 
action, the marriage of Miss Taylor to Mr Weston. This is represented 
sparingly as an event that has just passed, so, simultaneously, we also need to 
think in a 'how' mode. Percy Lubbock would describe its manner of being 
registered as a 'summary' rather than a 'scene'; had it been a 'scene' we might 
have had a full account of the wedding, its social interactions represented 
in the dialogue or direct speech which is such a strong component of later 
significant 'scenes' in the novel, such as the ball at the Crown, Highbury, in 
Chapter 38." This is characteristic of the flexible resources of prose narra/ 
tive in its relations to the representation of events; the chronological duration 
of an event is seldom equivalent to the volume of narrative discourse alio/ 
cated to it; after all, going back to the passage, twenty/one years of Emma's 
life pass in the space of five/and'a/bit shortish paragraphs. 

But there is more to be said about this summary of Miss Taylor's marriage: 
it represents Emma's relationship to the event. Because Emma has lost by 
Miss Taylor's union, it is a source of mild grieving. We could plausibly 
argue that this summary performs an aesthetic function, blending the 'what' 
and the 'how' into a unity: its brevity conveys a mood which seeks to block 
out an event which has brought 'gentle sorrow'. The emptiness and loss 
which the union between others has brought to Emma are woven together 
to produce the basis for further development of the story. But the mean/ 
ingfulness of that story depends on adopting a particular point of view. 
Point of view is a very important concept in the reading of narrative, 
made central, as we have seen, by the criticism of Percy Lubbock. When 
Lubbock laid down criteria for artistically successful fiction, he conceived it 
in terms of the unity and consistency of perceptual focus: in other words, 
which character sees what, and how that governs the reader's relationship to 
the story. This understanding of point of view will be an important one in 
analysing Emma, and I'll explore it in more depth in the next section, which 
will move beyond the passage we have been analysing to this point.

Character and point of view in Emma 25 

2.5 Character and point of view in Emma 

Marriages ? which legitimate sexual unions and order the transmission of 
property ? convey certain connotations in drama and narrative; they are 
rooted in the ancient emplotments of romance and comedy. So a wedding 
that deprives Emma of companionship so early in a narrative creates an 
expectation of restitution, or the completion of Emma by means of another 
union. How is the implied reader's investment in this romantic and comic 
outcome, blended with the theme of individual judgement and authority, 
sustained by characterisation and point of view? It is largely the result of the 
construction of Emma's character and point of view. 

E. M. Forster's influential Aspects of the Novel (1927) was in some sense a 
rejoinder to Lubbock's theory of fictional art. Forster ? a novelist himself ? 
makes a useful distinction between 'flat' and 'round' characters. Mr Wood/ 
house would be a 'flat' character, statically fixated on his hypochondria and 
domestic comfort; on the other hand, Emma would be a 'round' character, 
manifesting complexity and the potential for development. This is a useful 
distinction up to a point, so long as it does not encourage us to think that 
the property of 'roundness' inheres in particular characters who come to 
dominate a story by sheer force of 'personality'. Rather, 'roundness', or the 
effect of personality and complex selfhood, is something that is generated by 
the structural relations between various components of a narrative discourse, 
and the implied reader's investment in that process of structuration. How 
does this work? 

In one sense, Emma is as predictably flat as Mr Woodhouse in that she 
comes to be associated with a finite number of traits: a drive to make matches 
and a sense of her own infallible powers of judgement. This is evident from 
the primary material for structuring character, the dramatised, mimetic 
discourse comprising Emma's direct speech: '"Everybody said that Mr 
Weston would never marry again . . . Some people even talked of a promise 
to his wife on her death/bed, and others of the son and uncle not letting him 
go. All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject, but I believed 
none of it"' (p. 43). Although Emma asserts her correctness in emphatic 
terms, the implied reader, reading Emma ironically from the perspective 
established by the narrator, may surmise that the possibility of a death/bed 
promise and intra/family conflict is more than 'solemn nonsense'. Emma is 
further 'rounded' by the rhetorical position adopted by Mr Knightley's 
direct speech in this exchange: Knightley suggests that Emma's 'success' in 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



26 The elements of narrative analysis 

matchmaking is due to lucky guessing rather than 'endeavour'. Mr 
Knightley's speech does two things: first, it provides us with an alternative to 
Emma's perspective; and, second, it creates an expectation of development, 
that Emma will move beyond her own perspective. Knightley, who shares 
the narrator's attitude to authority, expresses the view that Emma will be 
completed when she comes to know the 'worthy employment for a young 
lady's mind' (p. 43). This sense of proper feminine worth is a recurrent topic 
of Mr Knightley's speech about Emma, as we see in Chapter 5, where he 
laments the fact that she consistently fails to follow through an improving 
programme of reading (pp. 65?6). We will return to the topic of literacy 
and appropriate feminine behaviour from a different critical perspective 
towards the end of this chapter. 

The expectations of rounding and completion that are generated around 
the character of Emma are complemented by the fact that readers are 
presented with more varied means than direct speech and others' views of 
her for building a profile of Emma's traits and characteristics. In addition, 
the reader has a special relationship to Emma because of privileged access to 
Emma's 'inner life'. These are established for the reader through verbal 
formulations which register, first, Emma's point of view, and, second, 
Emma's private thoughts. This use of point of view and inner thought is 
quite fundamental to the workings of Jane Austen's narrative. In Wayne 
Booth's study of Emma in The Rhetoric of Fiction, Booth described these 
workings as Jane Austen's 'control of distance'. By this he meant that Jane 
Austen's narrator controls the reader's relationship to Emma's point of view 
on the events of the story very carefully, balancing closeness to and 
involvement in Emma's discourse ? her direct speech, inner thoughts and so 
on ? with a more distant and objectified assessment of the accuracy and 
validity of Emma's judgements. 20 

For illustration, it is helpful to look closely at the episode in which Emma 
encourages the ingenue Harriet Smith to reject the attentions of Mr Robert 
Martin, a tenant farmer, while simultaneously hatching her plot to match 
Harriet and Mr Elton, the young unmarried clergyman. Emma's point 
of view is established by the narrator in the sentence 'Emma watched her 
[Harriet] through the fluctuations of this speech, and saw no alarming 
symptoms of love' (p. 60). But in becoming aware that we are restricted to 
Emma's point of view, the implied reader is invited to 'peer beyond' the 
limitations of Emma's viewpoint. This is where more recent critics such as 
Genette and Rimmon/Kenan have argued that Booth's own work does not 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



Character and point of view in Emma 27 

go far enough, and that a more nuanced concept than point of view is 
required, advocating in its place the concept of focalisation. 21 Focalisation 
distinguishes between who sees (Emma), and who speaks (the narrator). 
Readers can only 'peer beyond' using the words provided by the narrator 
(and/or implied author), and here the word 'fluctuations' helps us to do this: 
it suggests an uncertainty in Harriet's speech, the true significance of which 
Emma fails to appreciate, because its source is Harriet's dilemma in pleasing 
her new, powerful mentor at the expense of rejecting Martin's interest in her. 

The 'blindspots' in acts of focalising centred on Emma are further 
manifest when we are given access to Emma's 'inner thoughts'. As Mr Elton 
praises Emma's portrait of Harriet, Emma's inner voice thinks: 'Yes, good 
man! ... but what has all that to do with taking likenesses? You know 
nothing of drawing. Don't pretend to be in raptures about mine. Save your 
raptures for Harriet's face' (p. 71). Emma's 'inner thoughts' intimate just 
enough of what is going on 'outside' of them for the reader to conclude that 
Mr Elton is attracted to Emma rather than Harriet. In the gap that emerges 
between what Emma sees, thinks and predicts at the level of discourse, and 
what can be glimpsed in the wider context of the unfolding story, the 
implied reader follows a narrative based on a number of dramatic ironies, 
reversals of romance expectations, and the potential for moral trans/ 
formation. 

What are these ironies and reversals? In trying to make a match between 
Harriet and Elton, Emma fails to see that Elton wants Emma herself as a 
wife rather than Harriet. Second, in thinking that Frank Churchill is vying 
for her affections, and fearing that Mr Knightley is falling in love with Jane 
Fairfax, Emma fails to note that Frank and Jane are surreptitiously attached 
to each other (by contrast, Knightley sees this). Finally, in fearing that Mr 
Knightley is falling in love with Harriet, Emma comes to realise that she 
herself loves Mr Knightley. This reversal is brought home to her as a result 
of the picnic at Box Hill (Chapter 43), which represents the crisis and com/ 
pletion of Emma's moral transformation. Emma, playing to her audience 
by making a joke at the expense of the garrulous spinster Miss Bates, is 
castigated by Knightley, the authoritative keeper of the conscience of the 
community. Knightley reminds Emma that her joke was hurtful because 
Miss Bates 'is poor; she has sunk from the comforts she was born to . . . Her 
situation should secure your compassion' (p. 368). This, in terms of values, 
is the biggest reversal of all in a narrative which began with a seeming 
celebration of youth, good looks, cleverness and wealth. The narrator's 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



28 The elements of narrative analysis 

focus on Emma's inner thoughts and feelings here registers the scale of the 
moral earthquake: 'she was vexed beyond what could have been expressed 
? almost beyond what she could conceal. Never had she felt so agitated, 
mortified, grieved, at any circumstance in her life' (p. 369). 

If the implied reader has negotiated the balance between 'closeness' to and 
'distance' from Emma's evaluations in line with the various cues that are 
offered by the narrator and implied author, then the closure, or completion, 
of the story ought to be satisfying. The frustrated expectation of romance is 
satisfied by Emma's marriage to Knightley, whilst the marriage to Knightley 
is permissible because of Emma's own completion, and her having acquired 
a rounded sense of her powers and responsibilities in the community. The 
formal 'pleasure' derived from reading Emma resides in the reader having 
been inside Emma's limited perspective, whilst also being able to see around 
it. I said at the beginning of this formal reading of Emma that the opening 
paragraphs of the novel raise the issue of individual judgement through 
Emma's relationship to her governess, and that the direct speech and inner 
thoughts which construct Emma also present her as a figure who is proud of 
her independence of thought and judgement. In the light of this, the open/ 
ing up of Emma's private judgement to the authoritative view vested in the 
narrator and Knightley could be seen as a triumphant aesthetic integration 
of form (the control of distance through focalisation) and content (a story 
about the dangers of unfettered individual judgement and its correction). 
This is, as I have suggested, pleasurable: but there is also an embedded 
moral, educational dimension to the implied reader's investment. 

2.6 Limitations of the formal approach: social spaces and 
voices in narrative, from free indirect speech to social 
contexts 

This approach to Emma is important because it helps us to read the formal 
properties of narrative in elaborate detail. We become skilled close readers 
if we follow this kind of approach, and that enables us to appreciate the 
complex aesthetic invitations that forms of narrative we call 'literary' offer. 
But a reading of Emma may need to account for more than this. While the 
implied reader of this kind of narrative responds to formal elements and 
relations, we would have to acknowledge that even forms have histories 
which are, at some level, homologous to the power relations at work in 
society. It is important to remember that novels are strongly marked by the 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



Limitations of the formal approach 29 

distinguishing discourses of class and gender that operate and discriminate 
in the social world. In the case of Emma, it is Mr Knightley ? a higlvborn, 
male landowner ? who, by integrating and reforming the relations between 
individual judgement, authority and romantic love, is pivotal to the implied 
reader's aesthetic satisfaction. And it is Emma, a high/status woman of the 
gentry class, who is the object of that reform. In moving beyond the formal 
approach we need to account for the impact that social categories have on 
our interpretation of the forms which construct the 'what' and 'how' of 
narrative. 

For example, when Seymour Chatman discusses things and objects, or 
'what' a narrative is about, in addition to events and characters he includes 
settings (basically, where the story takes place). But setting is not just some 
inert 'background': Chatman wants us to be aware that setting is always 
narrated, which is why he coins the concepts of 'story space' and 'the focus 
of spatial attention'. 22 The latter concept is especially helpful for thinking 
about the mediation of social values. In Emma, the story space is pre 
dominantly the village of Highbury, and the focus of spatial attention is on 
three properties and their owners, all of whom are from the gentry class: 
Hartfield (the Woodhouses), Randalls (the Westons) and Donwell Abbey 
(Knightley). As Chatman remarks, story space is always mediated by 
focalisation (so the question of 'what' is practically inseparable from 
questions of 'how'), and in Emma this provides a helpful way of high/ 
lighting the social discriminations which structure Emma's focus of spatial 
attention. This is where we need to make reference to the Coles, a socially 
ambitious family relatively new to Highbury: they come from a trading 
background and have accumulated wealth which makes them second only 
to the Woodhouses. Yet, they and their property are only conditionally 
admitted into Emma's focus of spatial attention; 'the Coles were very 
respectable in their way, but they ought to be taught that it was not for them 
to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit them' (pp. 
217-18). 

We should note, however, that the narrative voice puts distance between 
itself and Emma's class'conscious haughtiness. It does this by subtly 
ironising Emma's condescending social attitude to the Coles by using a 
technique, when reflecting on Emma's subsequent visit to the family, that has 
become known as free indirect speech: 'she must have delighted the Coles ? 
worthy people, who deserved to be made happy! ? and left a name behind 
her that would not soon die away' (p. 239). While Emma is the focaliser it 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



30 The elements of narrative analysis 

is the narrator who speaks, so the character is speaking indirectly rather than 
directly ? except, it appears, in the emphatic remark after the slashes 
('worthy people ...'), which is in a markedly different register from the 
narrator's and is clearly Emma's direct and unappealing, self-regarding 
speech. As Rimmon/Kenan remarks, free indirect speech juxtaposes the 
language of the narrator and character and 'can assist the reader in recon/ 
structing ... attitudes towards ... character'. 2 ' 

Rimmon/Kenan interprets such blending and clashing of voices in the 
context of the formal relationship between narrator, character and implied 
reader, and whilst this is a valid starting point, it needs to be located in a 
particular context: that is, discourses about the countryside and social 
relations in southern England in the first decades of the nineteenth century, 
the extra/textual setting for Austen's work, and where Austen resided. In 
The Country and the City (1973), Raymond Williams argues that the formal 
sophistication of Austen's narratives subtly addresses the anxieties about a 
changing social structure in the countryside, brought about by the influx of 
new money derived from trading families (the Coles in Emma), and felt 
keenly among members of Jane Austen's traditional gentry class (of whom 
Emma herself is a representative). 21 

Viewed from this perspective, we may argue that the narrator is imagina/ 
tively rehearsing and resolving inter/class tensions between new, wealthy 
tradespeople and the gentry through subtly ironic narrative devices: in the 
same way as Emma has to learn a more sympathetic attitude to poor spinsters 
like Miss Bates, the implied reader surmises that Emma ought to adopt more 
gracious and generous manners towards the Coles (precisely because Emma 
is their social superior; the narrator does not doubt that). This is a further 
indication that the establishment of norms in a novel is seldom a matter of 
simple assertion, but instead a complex rhetorical activity. Moreover, the 
norms or values that the implied reader is asked to negotiate through reading 
the narrator's account of the relations between heroine, characters and their 
settings are socially specific. 

Social specificity is highlighted in Williams's work on the countryside 
context. This adopts a comparative focus which looks beyond Austen's 
novels about manners, to writers who represented the same countryside 
space and class tensions more explicitly, such as her near contemporary 
William Cobbett, the radical journalist and social observer. Cobbett com/ 
posed non/fictional essays (Rural Rides, 1822?6, published as a work 1830) 
about worsening social conditions in the English countryside, travel

narratives which construct a radically different focus of spatial attention ? 
farms and villages in decline ? and which seeks to persuade its reader of a 
need to reverse the new monetary, fiscal and capitalist system which 
permeates rural society. 25 Williams claims that Cobbett's social observations 
crafted conventions which would come to be used by novelists who sought 
to write about the interaction between different social classes after 1830 (we 
will analyse one such novelist, Charles Dickens, in Chapter 4). 2S Williams's 
cultural criticism asks us to consider the view that novels are forms of 
imaginative narrative which, though enormously important in themselves, 
exist in the presence and on the borders of competing and contrasting 
narratives. 

This is our bridge to a discussion of the novel as an emergent cultural form 
embedded in history and diverse sources of prose narrative and social and 
cultural debate, for the novel is an institution which has been formed out of 
a complex cultural history. It can be argued that the novel has been the 
central developing institution in the long and contested revolution in 
language, literacy and reading that characterises the period since 1780; a 
point evidenced in the interest expressed in the form by the two major 
English schools of social and cultural criticism in the twentieth century, 
F. R. Leavis's Scrutiny movement, and Raymond Williams's cultural 
materialism/ 7 In order to take an early snap-shot of this history in the 
making I will turn to a text that is commonly regarded as being one of the 
first major novels in English, Pamela by Samuel Richardson, which was 
published over seventy years before Emma in 1740. 

2.7 What happens in Richardson's Pamela? 

Turning to Pamela, and comparing it with Emma, we will find a different 
reading experience. Pamela Andrews marries her master, the gentleman 
Mr B.; she is from a lower social class than Emma Woodhouse: she is a 
servant girl. Pamela's low status makes her path to marriage much more 
dangerous and disturbing. Following the death of Pamela's mistress, the 
sexually predatory intentions of the mistress's son towards her are soon 
apparent. After a number of attempted assaults, Mr B. gives way to Pamela's 
protestations in defence of her virtue; she is seemingly allowed to return to 
her parents. Instead, the coach in which she travels is diverted to her master's 
Lincolnshire estate, where she is held as a virtual prisoner by the grotesque 
Mrs Jewkes. In the journal which she begins in the new environment,

32 The elements of narrative analysis 

Pamela records her attempt to escape with the aid of Mr Williams, her 
master's clergyman, though this escape is foiled. Mr B. plots a sham marriage 
to entrap Pamela, though Pamela sees through this trick. Mr B. comes to 
respect Pamela's virtue and the pair marry legitimately. In the last phase 
of Richardson's 1740 version the local gentry, embodied in Lady Davers 
(Mr B.'s sister), accept the pair after expressing extreme hostility. 

These are the 'events' of the narrative, so to speak. While I'll point to the 
way in which the critical vocabulary of formalism can highlight narrative 
similarities between Pamela and Emma, I'll also endeavour to explain the 
relationship between Richardson's narrative framework and debates about 
telling the truth in narrative, class, gender and literacy within an expanding 
print culture. This is not a matter of dispensing with formal analysis: rather, 
it is a case of embedding key aspects of it in a social and cultural context. 



2.8 First'person narration and the epistolary form: 
the dramatised narrator, rhetoric and the narratee 

Richardson's Pamela is narrated differently from Emma in so far as Pamela is 
a dramatised, first/person narrator who tells her own story in letters (the 
epistolary form) and a journal. This is the opening of her narration: 

My dear Father and Mother, 

I have great trouble, and some comfort, to acquaint you with. The trouble is, that 
my good lady died of the illness I mentioned to you, and left us all much grieved 
for the loss of her; for she was a dear good lady, and kind to all us her servants. 
Much I feared, that as I was taken by her ladyship to wait upon her person, I 
should be quite destitute again, and forced to return to you and my poor mother, 
who have enough to do to maintain yourselves; and, as my lady's goodness had 
put me to write and cast accompts, and made me a little expert at my needle, and 
otherwise qualified above my degree, it was not every family that could have 
found a place that your poor Pamela was fit for: But God, whose graciousness to 
us we have so often experienced, put it into my good lady's heart, on her death/ 
bed, just an hour before she expired, to recommend to my young master all her 
servants, one by one; and when it came to my turn to be recommended (for I was 
sobbing and crying at her pillow) she could only say, 'My dear son!' and so broke 
off a little; and then recovering, 'Remember my poor Pamela!' And those were 
her last words! O how my eyes overflow! Don't wonder to see the paper so 
blotted! (p. 43) 28 

It is important to recognise that the first paragraph of Pamela's first letter is, 
above all, the opening of an elaborate act of story/telling. Pamela's letter 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



First'person narration and the epistolary form 33 

performs a similar function to the first paragraph of Emma: the chronology 
of Pamela's story (upbringing, employment, training) is embedded in 
Pamela's epistolary discourse. This discourse reveals the central character's 
servant status whilst disclosing something of her origins: allusions to 
destitution and hardship indicate that Pamela comes from a poor but devout 
family. References to the skills she has been required to refine by her kindly 
and enlightened, but now dead, employer ? account/keeping ('cast 
accompts'), needlework and, above all, writing ? indicate that she has been 
raised somewhat above her station, a factor which imperils Pamela's chances 
of future employment. This sense of reversal is supported by key oppo' 
sitions: 'trouble' and 'comfort' create a tension in the first sentence, rather in 
the way that ideas of independence and authority create a tension in Emma. 
This, taken with the death of Pamela's mistress as the event which initiates 
the narration, generates expectations which will themselves, readers discover 
as they progress, be subject to reversal: what appears a source of comfort 
(Pamela's employment by the new master of the house) becomes a source of 
trouble. 

What is the effect of the first'person epistolary form on reading? The 
terms that I have used in the analysis above point to the difference; in the 
opening paragraph of Pamela matters relating to the story are revealed, 
disclosed, alluded to, indicated: their significance has to be inferred. They 
could be said to be, to call again upon Lubbock's distinction, 'shown' rather 
than 'told'. Following Henry James's late nineteenth/century interest in the 
novel as a form of writing which, through point of view, could show the 
subtle movements and shades of human consciousness, Lubbock thought 
he could see in Richardson's fiction the germ of his own preference for 
narrative that would 'show a mind in action ... [and] give a dramatic 
display of the commotion within a breast'/ 9 A good example of this occurs 
at the end of the first paragraph of Pamela: Pamela's grief at the death of her 
mistress is 'shown' to us in the ink blotted by her tears, an image of intense 
sensibility which apparently closes the gap between Pamela's emotional 
mind, her body, her written words and the reader. 

Except that the gap is not closed, at least not on the basis of the reader's 
being 'shown' this. As we have already established, all narration is telling to 
a greater or lesser degree. 'Showing' the effects of Pamela's tears would 
require someone to sob over the wet ink of every 'Letter I' of the work as it 
rolled off the press. Instead Pamela is telling, or, as the rhetorically aware 
Wayne C. Booth would insist, actively persuading, her reader of the depth 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



34 The elements of narrative analysis 

of her grief. Or, to be more precise still, Pamela, the narrator, addresses and 
seeks to persuade her parents ? 'My dear Father and Mother, . . . Don't wonder 
to see the paper so blotted!' The parents may be said to constitute the text's 
narratees, addressees who intercede between the narrator and implied reader. 
The narratee features in Chatman's model of the narrative transaction, yet 
we had no cause to draw on this category when analysing Emma. This 
is because explicit narratees are not obvious in every narrative text. The 
narratee is obvious in Pamela in the sense that someone identifiable ? and 
sometimes unidentifiable ? is always being narrated to. Narratees are inv 
portant to the rhetorical project that the text is performing for its implied 
reader. 

What sort of a reader is implied, and what is the rhetorical project? The 
title page of the 1801 edition of Pamela retained much of its 'machinery' 
from the first edition of 1740 and is highly explicit in framing what will 
follow, and its reader is initially inscribed rather than implied: 

Pamela; / or, / Virtue Rewarded. / In a / Series of Letters / From a Beautiful 
Young Damsel to Her Parents: / And Afterwards in Her Exalted Condition, / 
Between Her, And Persons of Figure and Quality, / Upon the / Most Important 
and Entertaining Subjects / In Genteel Life / ... Published in Order to 
Cultivate the Principles / Of Virtue and Religion in the Minds of the / Youth 
of Both Sexes, (p. 27) 

The inscribed reader is drawn from 'the Youth of Both Sexes' who are to be 
educated in the principles of virtue and religion. These principles will be 
conveyed through Pamela's letters to her parents, which, additionally, will 
impart knowledge of 'Important' and 'Entertaining' kinds relating to 
'Genteel' society. The ' Truth' and 'Nature' on which these letters are founded 
is guaranteed by the 'Editor' of the volume in a subsequent 'Preface', and it 
is also claimed that 'an Editor can judge with an impartiality which is rarely 
to be found in an Author' because 'his own passions ... have been uncom/ 
monly moved in perusing it' (p. 31). Here, the editor is a self-styled reader 
rather than a writer, who makes claims for the truthfulness of the letters that 
follow precisely because he has read, collated and had his own sensibility 
touched by them. The idea of the power and influence of writing is per/ 
vasive throughout this framework. 

We should pause here for a moment to recall the way in which Emma 
presented itself to its first readers, for the contrast is quite striking. As we saw 
at the beginning of this chapter Emma announces itself simply as 'a novel'. 
Part of what that assumes and implies was what we spent a good deal of 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



The narratee and writing as an 'event' 35 

space analysing, making its implicit framework and machinery explicit 
through the formal analysis of its narrative. In Pamela the machinery and 
framing devices remain explicit, informing the implied reader how power/ 
ful the reading experience will be. Of course, Pamela is still a fiction, and 
Richardson was not an editor but an author more or less making it up. But 
this 'fact' is outside the frame we are considering in the same way as Austen's 
actual authorship was always a mediated concern in our approach to Emma, 
even when we became concerned with questions of her class. This detour 
into the explicit framework of Pamela takes us back to the point about 
Pamela narrating to narratees: those who 'feel' the power of Pamela's letters 
and journals in the story. The following analysis of the narratee will help us 
to link Pamela to cultural contexts and debates about truth and represen/ 
tation in the 1740s; this will in turn lead to a discussion (sections 2.11?14) 
of some of the questions that motivate inquiry into the origins of the novel. 

2.9 The narratee and writing as an 'event' in Pamela 

Pamela alludes to her writing skill in her first letter to her parents, and there/ 
after she writes copiously. Although Richardson thought that in having his 
character 'write to the moment' he was employing a technique which would 
capture the transparent, immediate reality of Pamela's subjectivity, many 
present/day readers find it unconvincing. The fact that Pamela has seem/ 
ingly to spend every available minute ? that is to say when she is neither being 
assailed by the libertine Mr B. nor in a swoon ? writing about these assaults 
and collapses strains at their tacit assumptions about 'realism' in narrative. 
But there have been many 'realisms' in the modern history of prose narrative, 
as we will see in the chapters to follow. Often, a sense of what is convincing 
or 'real' is conditioned by over/familiarity with the smooth workings of a 
narrative framework such as we find in a novel by Austen. What needs to be 
questioned here is not the veracity of Richardson's text, but a rather rigid 
adherence to certain ways of handling the categories of analysis that have 
been presented to us by the formal tradition. As well as looking at events 
comprising the story which Pamela's epistolary discourse records, we should 
also look at Pamela's acts of writing as events in themselves which act upon 
their narratees. 

Pamela's writings are presented as the source of two major 'conversions' 
in Pamela: Mr B. casts off his libertine ways and comes to honour Pamela's 
virtue, and Lady Davers sets aside her aristocratic pride and comes to accept 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



36 The elements of narrative analysis 

the lowborn Pamela as a legitimate marriage partner for her brother. It is in 
this sense that we have to see Mr B. and Lady Davers as narratees, or figures 
who read Pamela's letters and journal. There are numerous narratees in 
Pamela. Some are intended: Pamela writes for her parents. Some narratees are 
not intended: it is soon clear that Pamela's letters home are being intercepted 
and read by Mr B. Some narratees are confronted with conflicting accounts 
of the same story: when Pamela finds herself in the house of one of Mr B.'s 
tenant farmers (Letter XXXII) en route to Lincolnshire, she attempts to 
persuade her hosts ? an audience consisting of the farmer, his wife and a 
daughter ? of the truth of her story only to discover that Mr B. has already 
sent a letter containing a conflicting account to them. In this drama played 
out before a number of narratees, Pamela's story of her determination to 
protect her virtue against her master's sexual despotism wins the sympathy 
of the farmer's young daughter, but not the farmer, who remains on the side 
of patriarchy and landed authority. A drama of identification rooted in 
class, gender and generation, but weighted unquestionably towards 
sympathy for Pamela, is as explicit here as the narrative framework is about 
the conclusion that the implied reader should reach. 

When landed authority itself becomes an unintended narratee, in the 
person of Mr B., he is moved to sympathy by Pamela's story: Mr B. tells 
Pamela that his overhearing her 'pretty chit/chat to Mrs Jewkes the last 
Sunday night' ? presented to the reader as Pamela in a mode of confessional 
recollection (p. 238) ? 'half disarmed my resolution [to rape her], before I 
approached your bed' (p. 251). It is expected then that when Mr B. does 
eventually get to become an authorised reader ? Pamela grants him 
permission to read the letters and journals that she has sewn into her 
underclothing for secrecy and protection ? he is converted by the story he 
reads, as he relates to Lady Davers: 'she may ... make as great a convert of 
you from pride, as she has of me from libertinism' (p. 443). Having been 
converted by another of Pamela's self-justifying narrations, Lady Davers 
also requests to read Pamela's letters and journals. 

Of course, Pamela reports all of these events and testimonies of affect 
subsequently in either letters or her journal, the very papers that Lady 
Davers desires to read. At key points in the story, we are reminded of the 
massive inventory of writings, and the events and feelings they relate, that 
Pamela has accumulated (p. 316). Indeed, the whole narrative scheme 
requires that we are attentive to the frequency, or number of occasions, upon 
which the same events are renarrated and reread by characters. This aware/ 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



Pamela, print culture and debates about genre 37 

ness of frequency is best conceived as a starting point for casting a much 
more productive light on the effects that Pamela's writings have on characters 
such as Mr B. and Lady Davers: in fact, rather than simply 'reporting' 
events, we could say that Pamela's letters and journal entries are events which 
help to determine the outcome of the story that at one level they are only 
supposed to record. Once this way of looking at a formal detail of narration 
? writing as an event which dramatises affect and influence ? is acknow 
ledged we can begin to reintegrate Pamela into debates about the role of 
literacy in reconstructing social and cultural authority in the mid eighteenth 
century. 

2.10 Pamela, print culture and debates about genre: the 
familiar letter, criticism and 'the novel' 

Richardson's text became a much/debated publishing phenomenon in the 
1740s, and the interpretation of the character of Pamela, and the rhetorical 
function of her letters, were at the heart of a multi'faceted cultural debate 
about how the truth should be told in prose narrative. Richardson's purpose 
in representing the affective powers of Pamela's writing was didactic. But 
Richardson's didactic intentions were defined by an established but growing 
and internally differentiated 'print culture': that is to say, a growing trade in 
books and other printed matter. In addition to manufacturing editions of 
poetical works and dramatic texts, such as Shakespeare's, reinvented as 
classics which aimed to satisfy 'high' tastes, this print culture also produced 
reading material which aimed to satisfy the needs of new readers from an 
increasingly ambitious 'middling' social rank. These readers sought 
instruction and guidance in taste, civilised modes of behaviour and conduct. 
A self-educated man, Richardson was an exemplary contributor to this 
educative, enlightening domain of print culture in being a printer as well as 
an author. As Richardson himself acknowledged, Pamela was a consider/ 
ably expanded version of two letters exchanged between a father and his 
servant daughter which had featured in a conduct book commissioned by 
booksellers. Organised around advice letters which were designed to 
instruct 'Country Readers' in the approved, urbane ways of putting things 
into words (to 'indite'), Richardson found himself increasingly composing 
the letters to instruct readers in 'how to think and act' as well, using as a basis 
the story of a servant girl which had 'some slight foundation in truth', and 
dramatising her voice and story through an imitation of the so/called 
familiar letter. 30 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



38 The elements of narrative analysis 

One of the first novels thus came into being through Richardson's use of 
the familiar letter, an eighteenth/century prose genre. The most regular way 
of talking about the familiar letter at the time when Richardson was writing 
stressed its intimacy, and the way in which it granted access to the 'heart' of 
the person. This is certainly the way in which Richardson conceived of the 
familiar letter in Pamela: it was a window to her virtuous sincerity, and 
Pamela spoke the generic language of the familiar letter ? of spontaneity, 
transparency of motive and truth ? to assert as much. Richardson's view of 
the character he had created through his narrative method held that her 
virtue and integrity were transparently self-evident and truthful." 

Truth claims made in respect of the self-presentation of character in the 
familiar letter were scrutinsed and debated publicly in eighteenth/century 
print culture. As Thomas Keymer points out, the eighteenth/century critic 
Samuel Johnson was alert to the possibility that familiar letters were less 
transparent than they seemed: that is to say, they were addressed to a particu/ 
lar person, sought to effect a purpose, and thus constituted a rhetorical act of 
self-dramatisation to that end. Johnson formulated this rhetorical sense of 
the letter in his commentary on the artful letters of the poet Alexander Pope 
(written in the 1730s), which appeared in Johnson's biography of Pope 
(1781), another prose narrative genre (the characteristics of which we will 
examine in more detail in the next chapter). 32 

Johnson's sceptical reading of the familiar letter needs to be added to 
a discussion of Pamela's letters as events which effect the conversion of 
narratees such as Mr. B. and Lady Davers. For it provides grounds for an 
alternative reading of Pamela's performance in the genre. Indeed, such a 
reading was satirically aired in a debate conducted through the culture of 
print. Henry Fielding read Pamela's character sceptically when he wrote 
(anonymously) a parodic burlesque of Richardson's narrative framework 
entitled Shamela (1741). As the title implies, Fielding's narrative uses letters 
and journals to reveal a servant girl hypocritically manipulating her master's 
sexual desire for her in order to secure a marriage and social advantage (here 
'writing to the moment' includes writing in bed with the man alongside). 
We need to be alert here to the way in which anxieties about class, gender 
and the power of literacy are implicit in Fielding's parody. In Richardson's 
narrative, letters determine as well as record a story in which a servant girl 
morally reforms a man of the gentry class, marrying him and thus rising in 
the social scale to his station. Literacy ? Pamela's capacity to fashion an 
image of herself in narrative ? is an agent in this process. Fielding's satire 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



Pamela, print culture and debates about genre 39 

contests the moral legitimacy of Pamela's story and character, as well as 
asking questions about Richardson's narrative method, which placed no 
'check' on his character's subjectivism. Fielding was using fiction to explore 
the question: how does one tell the truth in narrative? 

Fielding pursued this question further in 1742 when he wrote Joseph 
Andrews, based on the ruse that Richardson's Pamela Andrews has a 
brother, Joseph, a footman who is equally determined to protect his virtue, 
this time against Lady Booby, a relative of Pamela's Mr B. Thus, Fielding 
contests Richardson's reading of gendered power relations in making Joseph 
the victim of a woman's sexual predatoriness. Fielding also contests 
Richardson's narrative of class elevation in the sense that the virtuous Joseph 
Andrews turns out not to be low born, but is instead the child of a gentle/ 
man, switched by gypsies at birth. 

In a preface to the work, Fielding attempted to categorise the form of 
writing that the reader would encounter. He calls it 'a comic epic/poem in 
prose'. In naming and practising this 'species' of writing, Fielding addressed 
an implied reader who was familiar with the gentlemanly study of classical 
literature and its schemes of generic classification. Fielding distinguished 
his production from the romance, the dominant form of European prose 
narrative in the seventeenth century: a courtly genre set conventionally in the 
distant past, concerning questing knights and their encounters with such 
fabulous entities as dragons and giants. In contrast to the aristocratic 
romance, Fielding's new species of writing was low and comic, representing 
'persons of inferior rank'. In classifying his writing as an 'epic/poem in 
prose', Fielding was describing a form of non/metrical narration which 
could authoritatively frame, embed and comment upon the elements of 
narrative with which we are now familiar, namely 'action, characters . . . and 
diction'." The classical story/telling techniques of epic are brought to the 
lowlife subject matter of prose." Fielding makes the narrator of Joseph 
Andrews tell Joseph's story in the third person. In other words, the narrative 
voice is as authoritative as the one which we have seen at work in the later 
Emma; though Fielding's narrator is much more obtrusive, and confides in 
the reader through a first/person address. Modern readers, with the benefit of 
hindsight, have little trouble in recognising Fielding's 'comic epic/poem in 
prose' as a novel. In the course of this discussion of the intertextual relations 
that define its position in a debate, I have presented it as an instance of a 
'genre in the process of coming into being' as Michael McKeon describes 
the origins of the novel in English. 35 Let us now move to a more theoretical 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



40 The elements of narrative analysis 

style of discussion to consider some of the major positions in the debate 
surrounding this phenomenon, before reconsidering Emma in the light of the 
questions posed in this debate. 

2.11 The debate about the origins of the novel 

In looking at the novel as a 'genre in the process of coming into being' 
literary historians are confronted by, in the words of J. Paul Hunter, 
'something unfocused, sprawling across genres and modes more or less 
indiscriminately'.' 6 Although it is commonly agreed that Pamela and Joseph 
Andrews occupy quite an advanced and mature position in the process and 
were more 'codified' or organised experiments, we can still see their generic 
heterogeneity quite explicitly in their narrative frameworks.' 7 As we have 
seen, Pamela was made from the familiar letter, the journal and the conduct 
book. But it also borrowed from a tradition of Protestant narratives record/ 
ing personal trials and spiritual self-scrutiny, which were often adapted from 
journals and diaries.' 8 1 am resisting the term 'autobiography' at present for 
reasons which will be explained in the next chapter, where we will look 
more closely at the naming of self-writing as 'autobiography' in its nine/ 
teentlvcentury context. Even so, it is clear that many of the prose genres over 
which these early novels 'sprawl' provide opportunities for representing the 
'inwardness' of character. 

There is an associated rhetoric of 'truth' at work in the narrative frame/ 
works of Pamela and Joseph Andrews which makes them similar. We have 
seen that Richardson, in claiming the existence of an organising editor who 
has collated his character's letters and journals, and in so doing has dis/ 
covered the truthfulness of the narrative they comprise, at least leaves open 
the possibility that the reader is reading 'real' history rather than a fiction. 
Joseph Andrews refers to itself as a 'true History' (Book 4, Chapter 16). 
Consequently there are similarities between these writings and the slightly 
earlier narratives by Daniel Defoe such as Robinson Crusoe (1719) and Moll 
Flanders (1722). Again, Defoe's narratives are generically heterogeneous, 
drawing variously upon the scientific travel journal, the criminal biography, 
and the confessional narrative of the penitent. His texts are also framed by 
complex editorial statements which position these narratives ambiguously 
between 'real' histories and fiction. 

How have critics and literary historians sought to explain the differences 
between Richardson and Fielding, and the distinctive similarities that 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



The rise of the novel 41 

characterise the narratives of Defoe, Richardson and Fielding? This is where 
we need to look at accounts of the rise of the novel, where identifications 
of the point of origin are as varied as the formalists' arguments over the 
vocabulary of narrative criticism." Perhaps it is most appropriate to say that 
the novel has come into being from multiple points of origin, culturally, 
linguistically, geographically, historically (a point I will return to in section 
5.6). It is as well to be aware of this when focusing on the stories of origins 
at work in a given culture ? in our case, a culture defined by English/ 
language writing and speech. This in itself is complex enough: as the 
following accounts will show, cultures are sites of conflict and contestation 
which prose narratives internalise in the very process of making the form 
that has come to be recognised as 'the novel'. 

2.12 The rise of the novel: Ian Watt and the tradition of 
formal realism 

One of the most powerful and enduring accounts of the origins of the novel 
in English is Ian Watt's influential study The Rise of the Novel (1957). Watt 
argues that the English novel came into being in the eighteenth century 
and that Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson and, to a lesser extent, Henry 
Fielding were the significant innovators. According to Watt, Defoe and 
Richardson crafted prose narratives which absorbed 'the general temper of 
philosophical realism'. 40 'Philosophical realism' was constituted principally 
in the empirical philosophy of John Locke, the seventeenth/century philos' 
opher who held that the associations and ideas that enable thought and the 
discovery of truth are apprehended by the individual's senses; a philosophy 
cal position known as empiricism. According to Watt, this had a profound 
impact on the writing of prose narrative. Archaic narrative types such as 
the romance, with their elaborate diction, distant/past settings and fantastic 
happenings, were abandoned in favour of story lines which were set in the 
present or recent past, and were more spontaneous and inventive in the way 
that they represented, in plain prose, the practical and plausible situations 
that individuals confronted in their everyday lives. 

The expanding eighteenth/century print culture served a growing reading 
public which was generated by a changing social structure. Accordingly 
Watt's thesis has a sociological dimension in that he linked the emergence of 
narratives about individuals to the rise of economic individualism. Daniel 
Defoe is a crucial figure, in that his narratives forge links between the 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



42 The elements of narrative analysis 

individualist ethics of Protestant theologies and the forms of competitive, 
individualist, economic activity which came increasingly to structure every/ 
day life.'" It is in this sense that Watt presents Robinson Crusoe as a founding 
moment in the rise of the novel. Defoe's narrative, in which the narrator 
recalls his God/guided struggle to bring the island on which he has been 
shipwrecked under his mastery, appealed to a growing commercial middle 
class, for whom Crusoe's battle with his circumstances constituted an exotic 
refraction of their own struggle with a new, competitive, capitalist world. 42 

Such narratives made individual perception of a material world their 
organising principle. First/person narration was a feature of Defoe's 
Robinson Crusoe and Moll Flanders, and as we have seen, it is Richardson's 
choice in Pamela. Watt notes how this first/person perspective is made more 
palpable by the presence of Pamela's elaborate descriptions of domestic 
detail." For Watt, narration which emphasises perception, the everyday 
world perceived, and the psychological movements of mind in the act of 
making sense of the world are at the basis of what he describes as 'realism of 
presentation'. Realism of presentation is, in turn, the cornerstone of Watt's 
construction of a tradition of narrative which initiates and propels the 'rise 
of the novel'. He calls this 'formal realism', which acknowledges the formal, 
conventional nature of a new way of mediating a middle/class world view, 
founded on the primacy of the individual. 

Watt's argument can be used to think about the status of much earlier 
popular prose narratives. Let us take Thomas Deloney's Jack of Newbury 
(1597) as an example. Jack of Newbury was a story set during the reign of 
Henry VIII, which, from the perspective of its late sixteenth/century reader/ 
ship, was relatively contemporaneous. Jack is a sober and industrious cloth/ 
worker who marries his recently widowed employer/mistress: there are 
anticipations of Pamela and virtue being rewarded. The narrative recounts, 
in a plain style, Jack's business success, his obedience and usefulness to the 
king (he assembles a troop of men to fight the battle of Flodden Field), and 
the social recognition increasingly bestowed on him. This culminates in the 
visit of the royal household to a banquet at Jack's home. Although royalty 
makes an appearance, the focus is on labour and the everyday existence of 
common people. Yet, Watt's theory of 'formal realism', and the emphasis 
it places on conventions for representing complex individuality, leads us to 
recognise the differences between Deloney's narrative and the later narratives 
of Defoe and Richardson. In Jack of Newbury, the eponymous figure 
represents little more than an allegorical substitute for the virtues of

Contested fields of cultural discourse 43 

paternalism, benevolence and loyalty, providing a point of continuity 
between the various episodes, as opposed to a character like Robinson 
Crusoe, who is individualised through first/person narration. 44 In spite of 
some novelistic qualities, Jack of Newbury does not fit into Watt's tradition, 
strengthening his claim about the foundation of that tradition in the 
eighteenth century. 

The difficulty for Watt, however, is that at the very moment that he posits 
the emergence of this tradition, he is confronted by an example from the mid 
eighteenth century which does not quite fit: Fielding's novels, as we have 
seen, reject the subjective narrative method preferred by Richardson. Watt 
accordingly adjusts and expands his theory of formal realism by dis' 
tinguishing between 'realism of presentation' and 'realism of assessment', 
evident in Fielding's third/person narration which 'assesses' characters and 
events 'objectively'. By this means, Watt is able to assimilate Fielding into the 
tradition of formal realism, especially when he argues for the developmental 
role played by the later writings of Jane Austen, which combined 'into a 
harmonious unity the advantages both of realism of presentation and 
realism of assessment'. 4 ' This certainly accords with the formalist reading of 
Emma developed in section 2.5, where we noted the way in which the 
narration moved between Emma's limited focalisation and the narrator's 
more 'objective' overview. However, the difficulty with Watt's solution is 
that, even though he begins with a social and cultural focus, he concludes 
by viewing the development of the novel as a sequential, problem/solving 
activity concerned with form, in the sense that Richardson and Fielding 
between them generate a problem which Austen comes along later and 
solves, thus getting herself elected to the tradition. This view is in danger of 
losing sight of questions of social and cultural context, and of allowing a 
teleology (reading the end back into the beginning and regarding progress 
to that end as inevitable) defined by formal questions to take over. 

2.13 Contested fields of cultural discourse and the rise of 
the novel: Lennard J. Davis and Michael McKeon 

More recently Lennard J. Davis's Factual Fictions: The Origins of the English 
Novel (1983) has noted the problem of teleology in approaches which 
become centred on constructions of continuous traditions. In response, 
Davis constructs a history of the novel which is concerned to stress breaks, 
discontinuities and the thresholds which separate the fields of discourse 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Page 



44 The elements of narrative analysis 

comprising 'culture'. Accordingly, he resists explaining the rise of the novel 
as a consequence of the decline of the courtly romance: for Davis, novel and 
romance were radically different genres.* Having made this break, Davis 
argues that the origins of the English novel can be located instead in a 
seventeenth/century culture of 'prose narrative in print', which included 
printed news ballads, the forerunners of newspapers. This produced what 
Davis describes as a 'news/novel discourse', an unstable blend of factual and 
fictional narrative. 47 This helps to explain not only the generic mixture that 
we find in novels by Defoe, Richardson and Fielding, but also the sense of 
ambiguity that we encounter when these fictional texts refer to themselves as 
'true histories'. Davis sees the ambiguities around the 'truth' status of early 
fiction as a consequence of its emergence from a complex field of discourse. 

Michael McKeon in The Origins of the English Not/el (1987) also locates 
the problem of the early novel's preoccupation with 'truth' within fields of 
discourse. McKeon pushes the origins of the English novel back into the 
early modern period (the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries), arguing that 
the writings of Defoe, Richardson and Fielding mark the culminating point 
of, and are in a sense produced by, a history of social conflict during which 
epistemological categories such as 'truth', and moral categories such as 
'virtue', were refined and debated within and between fields of phikv 
sophical, scientific, theological and political discourse. For McKeon class 
relations and conflicts drove this process, and changing forms of prose 
narrative internalised the contests that were being waged. The 'literary' form 
which has come to be recognised as the novel internalised these contests in 
special ways: McKeon argues that 'the distinctive feature of novelistic narra/ 
tive is the internalisation or thematisation of formal problems on the level of 
content . 

How did this work? We have already seen how, from the perspective 
of Ian Watt, the late Elizabethan Jack of Newbury does not belong to the 
tradition of the 'formal realist' novel. McKeon's approach does not set aside 
the need for traditions; instead it broadens the focus by reconstructing a 
multiplicity of narrative (and non/narrative) traditions, and traces the dia/ 
lectical interactions and conflicts that produced the novel. McKeon places 
Deloney's narrative in the context of a tradition of early modern stories 
about virtue which exalted the qualities of a particular class, in this case 
tradesmen. We noted how, given its theme of the virtuous figure who is 
rewarded with increased social recognition, Jack of Newbury seems to 
anticipate Pamela. 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



Gender and the rise of the novel 45 

Yet, this is to admit a teleology which McKeon's approach resists. For 
McKeon, Pamela as a narrative that we have come to recognise as a novel was 
produced when the story about virtue came under subsequent intellectual 
pressure to tell itself 'truthfully' in a formally self-conscious manner, and 
to internalise that truth at the level of content (Mr B.'s 'conversion'). 1 ' 
According to McKeon, the question of how to tell the truth in narrative 
had, by the mid eighteenth century, come to be contested by middle/class 
and aristocratic world views which placed themselves, respectively, at the 
opposite ends of two epistemological poles: naive empiricism and extreme 
scepticism. Richardson's choice of the familiar letter, and his claims for the 
'truth' of Pamela's virtuous sentiments that it transparently represented, can 
trace its antecedents to a middle/class preference for the philosophy of naive 
empiricism. In turn, such naively empirical stories concerned with virtue 
were contested by an extreme form of conservative scepticism, evidenced 
in the 1740s as we have seen in Henry Fielding's parodic Shamela, and 
then more positively in his Joseph Andrews. Thus, McKeon presents an his/ 
torical and theoretical interpretation of the social and discursive sources of 
the debate between Richardson and Fielding which we traced in section 
2.10. 

A consequence of this manner of tracing the debate is that it is difficult 
for us to read the novels of Richardson and Fielding without thinking of 
intertextual connections: not only between one fictional text and another, 
but also between fictional and non/fictional prose narratives and discourses. 
Moreover, fictional characters and the effects of 'realism' were not simply 
the artistic inventions of individual writers, but were produced out of em/ 
battled fields of discourse. This excursion into debates about the origin of 
the novel has the potential to alter radically the questions we ask when we 
read novels and prose narratives. Let us begin to return to Emma in the light 
of this new way of reading, approaching it by way of Nancy Armstrong's 
poststructuralist feminist thesis about the origins of the novel and its political 
role in constructing gendered subjectivity. 



2.14 Gender and the rise of the novel: the domestic woman 
and the production of subjectivities 

To what extent have critics recognised gendered discourses in their re/ 
construction of the early modern cultural conflicts from which the novel 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



46 The elements of narrative analysis 

emerged? For the most part, their role has been investigated by feminist 
critics. An important strand of feminist literary criticism aims to recover for 
women a central place in literary history and to construct a tradition which 
challenges a male'dominated canon. 

Alternatively, feminist critics such as Ros Ballaster and Nancy Armstrong 
adopt aproaches which are less author/ and work/centred, focusing instead 
on the cultural prevalence and power of discourses of gender and sexual 
desire." For Nancy Armstrong, this introduces a different orientation to the 
history of the novel; as she argues in Desire and Domestic Fiction (1987), 
Defoe's Robinson Crusoe 'does not inaugurate the tradition of the novel as we 
know it', for the novel as we know it is preoccupied with relationships 
between men and women. 52 Whilst they are durable, desert/island stories 
have not proved to be as reproducible as stories about sexual desire. 
Romantic novels about men, women and sexual desire had to be told again 
and again in different ways, according to Armstrong, because they were at 
the root of an English political settlement which 'was accomplished largely 
through cultural hegemony'." 

What is meant by this? Armstrong's thesis about the rise of the novel as a 
cultural institution with important political consequences is alert to the 
contexts of early modern social conflict that McKeon's approach highlights. 
In common with Davis and McKeon, Armstrong's method is intertextual, 
or a 'foray into extraliterary territory as part of an effort to suggest how fiction 
might have worked with other, very different forms of writing to produce a 
new form of political power'. 51 In other words, the novel emerged out of a 
variety of narrative and non/narrative sources to become a cultural insti' 
tution which absorbed and transformed the dangerous conflicts of society 
and politics into the microcosmic domestic world, the social and political 
conflicts being rewritten along lines of gender division. For Armstrong, the 
fact that Pamela is about a servant girl who marries the gentleman whose 
initial aim is her sexual conquest ? a lowborn expert in the domestic arts 
who converts a higlvborn gentleman from libertinism to romantic love and 
domestic responsibility ? makes it politically charged. Armstrong argues 
that representations of the domestic woman had come, by the early eiglv 
teenth century, to exercise a considerable degree of power: the domestic 
woman and the space of the household were seemingly above the social 
conflicts generated by the religious and political controversies which had 
dominated the seventeenth century. The domestic woman was a role which 
became familiar to all literate classes through conduct books for women 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



Gender and the rise of the novel 47 

which codified gender differences (the different roles played by men and 
women) and appropriate modes of behaviour. Armstrong argues that these 
provided literate classes with 'a figure of female subjectivity, a grammar ... 
[which] awaited the substance that the novel and its readers ... would 
eventually provide'." 

At issue here is the production of selves in and through forms of discourse 
and reading. Armstrong works from the poststructuralist position, which 
argues that individuals acquire subjectivities which are constructed from 
discourse: in other words female subjectivities were fashioned from reading 
positions, which were inscribed in certain texts and discourses. Conduct 
books provided the woman reader with a model of subjectivity based on 
domestic propriety, which could refashion the woman reader into the 
domestic subject of male desire. Reading experiences such as Pamela utilised 
the basic 'grammar' of a conduct book ? its culturally hegemonic figure of 
the domestic woman ? whilst making it into a dramatic narrative which was 
both exciting and improving. Armstrong proposes that the novel reader was 
created as a political subject whilst reading a novel. This is, as we saw at the 
very beginning of this chapter, the basic premise behind the idea of the 
implied reader: we have to adjust our subject position when we enter into 
another world of narrative discourse. But Armstrong's argument is more 
historically and critically pointed than this: she asks us to see novel reading 
as a practice which developed in history, and out of a variety of sources 
which had political implications. Her argument asks us to think about why 
some reading positions have become more powerful than others in their 
capacity for forming and sustaining subjectivities. According to Arm/ 
strong, Pamela initiates a very powerful tradition in the English novel, not 
least in the way that it is about the production of a self through the 
possession of literacy. 

Armstrong's reading of domestic ideology in Pamela stresses its place 
in the production of Pamela's self and the conversion of others. Pamela's 
virtue is based on her sensibility and the values of domestic propriety. But 
the innate virtue of Pamela's self has been, as we have seen, questioned by 
some readers (such as Fielding) on the basis of Richardson's chosen narra/ 
tive method. Armstrong reads this positively: she argues that Pamela's self 
is actually a rhetorically performed subjectivity constructed out of writing 
skills. Indeed, Pamela's only weapon in her struggle with Mr B. is her 
written self. It is a self which Mr B. desires to read; and, as we noted in 
section 2.9, it is a self which converts Mr B.'s wayward masculinity to the 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



48 The elements of narrative analysis 

domestic ideal once he has read it, a testimony to the power of the domestic 
ideal and its inscription in discourse. 



2.15 Re-reading Emma: letters, standards and intertextual 
allusion 

To what extent can Armstrong's thesis be used to read Emma as a narra/ 
tive? Or, to broaden the question: does our excursion into historical and 
theoretical readings of the origins of the English novel offer any openings for 
the rereading of Emma'. As we noted in the first part of this chapter, a formal 
reading noted the artistic integration of content and form in Austen's narra/ 
tive. The kind of approach adopted by Davis, McKeon and Armstrong 
disintegrates narrative into its social and cultural sources and contexts in 
order to understand its integretative power. Such an approach may be 
appropriate for 'early' novels which were characterised by seemingly clumsy 
frameworks, and which had no settled generic identity to speak of, but surely 
not for Emma, given its manifest artistic wholeness? 

There are two points that we can advance to answer this; both come from 
Michael McKeon. First, we have seen how McKeon's approach to the emer/ 
gence of the novel notes the way in which the novel is distinguished by the 
way in which content is internalised in the form of the narrative, a finding 
with which formalist approaches would be comfortable. But McKeon's 
thesis suggests that this characteristic is actually a product of historical 
dialectics. In other words, there is every reason to expect ourselves to be able 
to read culture and history in the content and formal arrangements of all 
novels. Secondly, McKeon notes that whilst it is true that early novels such 
as Pamela debate their cultural purpose and epistemological bearings 
through overt frameworks, or 'in the interstices of narrative itself, by 
Austen's time these explicit debates had been relocated to the periodical 
presses and into the discourses of 'fiction criticism' (of which more will be 
said in the next chapter)." The cultural function of the novel had not, 
however, changed. 

Consequently, as Armstrong argues, Emma is a story about the refor/ 
mation of subjectivity which draws upon the discourse of the domestic 
ideal. We noted in section 2.5 how Knightley wished for Emma to find 
'worthy employment for a young lady's mind' (p. 43) and how in Chapter 5 
he laments the fact that she consistently fails to follow through an improving 
programme of reading (pp. 65?6). The cultivation of domestic subjectivity 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



Rereading Emma 49 

is linked to literacy and reading, as in Pamela, though in Austen's novel 
it falls to the masculine Knightley to draw attention to the connection: 
Pamela's authority has passed to Knightley, and it is Emma who has to be 
regulated and reformed. 

Armstrong argues that Jane Austen's fiction pursued a different line 
to Richardson's in its concern with 'the regulation of literacy and ... 
language'." In Emma, literacy skills bring certain problems which contribute 
to the drama of the narrative, but which are managed by the narrator. Other 
prose genres are assimilated into the novel: Armstrong notes the part played 
by letters in the narrative, even though Emma is not an epistolary fiction in 
the way that Pamela is. In Emma some letters are represented as though in an 
epistolary fiction (Frank Chrurchill's letter at the end of the novel, for 
example). For the most part, however, letters are events which are reported 
by the narration: Frank Churchill's first letter is described in terms of the 
general reaction it provokes; Jane Fairfax's letter is reported when it is being 
read by her aunt, Miss Bates; most significantly, Robert Martin's letter 
proposing marriage to Harriet Smith is reported through Emma's negative 
commentary on its style. The issue that underpins these letters is one that 
never troubled Richardson in writing Pamela (though as we saw, it troubled 
his readers): what is the actual character of the person who has written these 
letters? Letters present interpretive problems in Emma which are intimately 
linked to the asymmetrical relations between status, writing, speech, gesture 
and personal worth that the novel explores. Frank Churchill writes an 
educated, stylish letter, but the sender is a deceiver; Robert Martin writes in 
a plain style which Emma takes to be an indication of his inferior status. Yet 
Knightley is on hand to point out the erroneous judgements that Emma 
makes, claiming that Martin's style is an indicator of self-assurance and 
good sense. Armstrong's point is that in the context of these problems the 
authoritative narrative voice, which we analysed at the beginning of this 
chapter, proposes itself as a standard of judgement and 'as a new standard 
for writing', which amounts to another perspective on the status of Emma as 
'literature'. 58 

But Austen's fiction had to face down competition from other styles 
of fictional writing which were held to debase this 'standard'. Although 
conflict and debate between writers and their styles was an explicit feature of 
the emergence of the early novel, Jane Austen's realist novel of manners was 
in implicit competition with other traditions of fictional writing, particu/ 
larly the gothic romance, a style of fiction which was was initiated by Horace 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Page 



50 The elements of narrative analysis 

Walpole's ami/realist Castle of Otranto (1764). This style of narrative re' 
cycled many of the features of the romance tradition: stories were set in 
castles and ruined abbeys in foreign parts and in the distant past; they 
incorporated fantastic and supernatural elements such as ghosts and 
hauntings. The narratives conventionally emphasised the terrorising effects 
of these happenings on the raw feelings and sensations of the characters, 
who were usually young women incarcerated in claustrophobic space by 
libidinous malcmaster figures. The gothic was dismissed by Ian Watt in his 
account of the formal realist tradition as a 'fugitive literary tendency', yet this 
is to overlook its importance in its day: Walpole's Otranto is discussed by 
Dunlop in his 1814 history of prose fiction whilst Austen, who had 
published Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice and Mansfield Park by this 
date, is not." 

Austen wrote a parody of the gothic romance in Northanger Abbey. But 
resistance to the gothic also intrudes into Emma allusively and intertextually. 
Harriet Smith informs Emma that she is urging the sensible Robert Martin 
to read a novel which has enthused her, The Romance of the Forest. This was 
a novel of the gothic romance genre which appeared in 1791, written by 
the leading exponent of the genre, Ann Radcliffe, perhaps the best'known 
writer of the gothic romance in English. Set in seventeenth/century Catholic 
Europe, The Romance of the Forest was narrated in the third person. Yet, in 
common with many gothic narratives, it emphasised the intense feelings and 
sensibility of the focaliser/heroine (Adeline), both in her responses to nature 
and apparent supernatural happenings. Emma, as we have noted, is about the 
dangers of unfettered judgement. The point seems to be that Emma had 
better reform herself before she does any more damage to the already half- 
ruined and impressionable Harriet, spoiled by the wrong kind of novel. 

The following chapter, which focuses on Victorian writing, will extend 
this exploration of the tensions between discourses of romance and realism 
and their relations to ideas about self- making. The chapter will also continue 
to discuss the intertextualities of the novel, specifically its relations to non/ 
fiction prose narrative genres such as the autobiography and the biography.

Bildung and belonging: studying nineteenth' century 
narrative and 'self' culture' 



3.1 The bildungsroman 

This chapter will explore ways of reading two important nineteenth/ 
century novels: Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre (1847) and George Eliot's The 
Mill on the Floss (1860), both powerful stories about the development of 
individual women (Jane Eyre and Maggie Tulliver) in testing circum/ 
stances. The last chapter analysed the early nineteenth/century Emma in 
terms of the development of her character: Emma matures and acquires a 
sense of responsibility to match her cleverness. She marries, thus balancing 
the desire for self-determination with the demands of socialisation. Emma 
undergoes an education in the way that the mid eighteenth/century Pamela 
does not: in consequence we can say that Emma is an early English example 
of the bildungsroman. 

'Bildungsroman' is from the German: 'bildung' means 'education' or 
'formation', and 'roman' means ? as it does in French ? 'novel'. Emma can 
be seen as a 'novel of education' or 'formation'. 1 The novel credited with 
being the first bildungsroman, Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship by the 
German writer J. W. Goethe (1796), ends in Wilhelm's happiness and 
fulfilment as he marries and thus completes the formation of his character 
as an end in itself. Wilhelm's formation ? the source of his happiness ? 
has been shaped (and even recorded) by a community (the Society of the 
Tower). Clearly 'bildung', the representation of an individual's education, 
formation and development, would be inconceivable without a community 
within which the story of development unfolded. Franco Moretti's study of 
the bildungsroman argues that this became an important narrative form in 
nineteenth/century Europe, which 'held fast to the notion that the biography 
of a young individual was the most meaningful viewpoint for the under/

Biography and autobiography 55 

standing and evaluation of history'. 2 Moretti's definition indicates that in 
the nineteenth century this form of the novel, and in some sense the idea of 
history itself, was grounded in biographical assumptions. Consequently, in 
focusing on two important nineteenth/century novels, this chapter will also 
think about ways of reading those novels' intertextual relationships to 
cognate prose narrative genres such as biography and autobiography. Here 
the focus texts will be Elizabeth Gaskell's biographical The Life of Charlotte 
Bronte (1857) and Samuel Bamford's autobiographical Early Days (1847). 

3.2 Biography and autobiography in the nineteenth century 

Biography means 'life (bios) writing (graphe)': this was first coined as 
an English word in 1683 by the poet and critic John Dryden. 3 It thus 
influenced eighteenth/century novelists, even if they adopted a satirically 
antagonistic attitude to the genre, as Fielding did in Joseph Andrews (book 3, 
chapter 1: 'Matter prefatory in Praise of Biography'). Biography was in 
fact an ancient genre which had its origins in public orations uttered at the 
funerals of military or political leaders in classical Greek and Roman cul/ 
tures. It involved a speaker narrating the person's career in military combat 
or public life. According to Bakhtin, these are the origins of 'biographical 
time'. 4 Biographical time sounds very like common sense, the time that it 
takes for a life to run its course from birth to death. But in practice it is always 
a cultural convention which selectively represents a particular configuration 
of events, time and space. Bakhtin makes the point that classical biography 
usually only included the events that comprised the individual's career and 
which bestowed the public identity: the biography of a commander would 
thus consist of a series of battles which would have occurred on battle 
fields. Such a biography would pay little attention to 'the time of a man's 
"becoming" or growth'. Thus, the new emphasis on individual 'growth' 
and 'becoming' which distinguished the nineteenth/century bildungsroman 
took biographical and novel narratives representing the lives of men and 
women in new directions. This was closely linked to the movement known 
as Romanticism, which proclaimed a new, naturccentred aesthetic in 
celebration of the creativity, inwardness and developmental powers of the 
individual self; perhaps its most representative document being Words/ 
worth's Prelude (published 1850, but composed 1799), an autobiographical 
poem in the first person narrating the 'growth' of the poet's mind. 

Accordingly, 'autobiography' was linked to this Romantic shift in 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Page 



56 Bildung and belonging 

mentality, even though self/scrutiny in prose was also a very ancient 
practice; 6 and, as we saw in the last chapter, some of the earliest English 
novels by Defoe were shaped by seventeenth/century Puritan narratives 
recording personal struggles and spiritual self-examination, adapted from 
journals and diaries. Of course, self-scrutiny in prose narrative continued 
to have important spiritual functions during the nineteenth century. But 
'autobiography' is very much a nineteenth/century generic term and 
concept; its first recorded use occurs in 1809, by the poet and critic Robert 
Southey.' Although Jean/Jacques Rousseau is credited with writing the 
first recognisably modern, secular autobiography in France in the 1770s, he 
entitled his work Confessions, a term usually reserved, after St Augustine, for 
spiritual self-scrutinies addressed to God. The nineteenth/century concept 
of autobiography stressed a literary, expressive connection between bios, the 
story of a life course, and autos, the cultivated and autonomous self respon/ 
sible for the act of narration which looks back to and reflects upon the 
'developmental' path travelled. Autobiography was an indicator of 'self- 
culture', or an ethos of self-improvement which was an important strand of 
the nineteenth/century conception of culture (see sections 1.8?9). Auto/ 
biography also lent itself to bildung/shaped narrative patterns and the 
cultural significance they attached to the formative stages of childhood and 
youth. 

3.3 The viewpoint of youth: bildung in nineteenth/century 
history 

Why was 'youth' granted such a privileged ? but also, as we shall see, 
troubled ? viewpoint on history at this time? The end of the eighteenth 
century and the beginning of the nineteenth was a period of great change, 
and communities found themselves in various states of transformation and 
upheaval. 

The French Revolution broke out in 1789; its ramifications were felt 
socially, politically and culturally. As part of their determination to throw 
aside artificial convention, Romantic poets such as William Wordsworth 
enthused initially about the democratic politics of the Revolution, which 
aimed to liberate the individual by transforming the aristocratic structures of 
French society and government. However, society proved a very stubborn 
structure, and the violence into which the Revolution degenerated alienated 
many of its initial supporters. 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Page 



The viewpoint of youth 57 

The French Revolution was a watershed event: it initiated decades of 
conflict culminating in the European revolutions of 1848, and, in Britain 
agitation for democratic rights centred on movements such as Chartism. In 
the immediate aftermath of the French revolution European societies were 
transformed by Napoleon Bonaparte's continental wars, conquests and 
empire building. Given Napoleon's humble beginnings, breathtaking rise 
and relative youth, a biographical explanation of world history seemed 
irresistible: when the German philosopher Hegel saw the victorious 
Napoleon ride through the streets after the Battle of Jena in 1806 he thought 
that he saw 'the World Spirit on Horseback'. 8 Napoleon's biography had a 
profound impact on French narratives about the relationship between the 
young individual and society. The ambitious young peasant Julien Sorel, 
whose ultimately tragic life history is the subject of Stendhal's bildungs' 
roman Le Rouge et le Noir (Scarlet and Black, 1830), seeks his inspiration in 
Napoleon, who, Sorel cries, '"was most certainly a man sent from God for 
the youth of France"'. 9 

By contrast Emma, published in 1816 just one year after Napoleon's defeat 
at Waterloo, was sent for the youth of England. It is often noted that 
Austen's fiction ignored the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. 
This is true in terms of surface detail, but Nancy Armstrong (see section 
2.15) reads Emma as a narrative of self-formation which sought to bind 
'youth' into a conformist cultural hegemony centred on the domestic values 
and writing standards of the rural English gentry. 

We should also recall that in section 2.6 we looked at Raymond 
Williams's account of the social and economic contexts of the countryside 
settings of Austen's novels, which highlighted the great changes that rural 
England was experiencing in the early years of the nineteenth century, and 
which intensified the need to reaffirm gentry values. These changes were in 
part due to the demands on agricultural production brought about by the 
Napoleonic Wars, but these wars were only accelerating increased economic 
activity which had its roots in the Industrial Revolution which was re 
structuring English society and culture. The consequences of this social 
restructuring had a major impact on the 'mission' of English fiction in the 
nineteenth century, as we shall see when we examine the work of George 
Eliot. Indeed, all of these changes generated a climate of debate in which the 
very processes by which individuals were 'made' were interrogated in both 
narrative and non/narrative, literary and non/literary discourses. 

Clearly, nineteenth/century history was a turbulent phenomenon on 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Page 



58 Bildung and belonging 

which to maintain a 'viewpoint'. In reading the focus texts in this chapter, 
we will of course think about viewpoint or focalisation in ways established 
in section 2.5: Charlotte Bronte's novel Jane Eyre (1847) is a fictional drama/ 
tised first/person narrative; the autobiography of the working/class radical 
Samuel Bamford, Early Days (1847), is also written in the first person. 
Elizabeth Gaskell's biography of Charlotte Bronte, The Life of Charlotte 
Bronte (1857), and George Eliot's realist novel The Mill on the Floss (1860) 
are third/person narratives. 10 Such grammatical and perspectival distinc/ 
tions are important starting points. But in so far as they shape the reader's 
perception of the relationship between bildung and belonging, individual 
and community, it will be important to study these examples of genre and 
focalisation as forms of gender/ and class/specific address which were em/ 
bedded in and resonant of the contexts of instability and change. As we 
shall see, narratives about individual formation could evaluate history from 
very different viewpoints which stressed either a sense of accommodation 
with society, or a sense of alienation and self-division; and, often, a mixture 
of the two. 

There is one other sense of belonging that we will need to bear in mind. 
Texts are intertextually complex tapestries of discourse which do not so 
much 'belong' to, but rather 'participate' in, genres, so that novels borrow 
autobiographical and biographical conventions, and vice versa. The lesson 
that we learned in looking at the origins of the novel can be used to read the 
novel and cognate forms of prose narratives from later periods where generic 
lines were ostensibly more clearly drawn. This in turn invites us to think 
about narratives as artefacts which perform ? through, for example, choice 
of register, a strain of allusiveness ? a sense of the way they 'belong' to, or 
more critically 'participate' in, the evaluations and discriminations that 
comprise culture. One of the major oppositions that we will chart in this 
chapter is that between realism and romance, which was (section 2.15) the 
source of Jane Austen's quarrel with the gothic romance. The use of 'realist' 
or 'romance' conventions will indicate, as we shall see, the narrative text's 
sense of its relationship to literary culture and, thereby, its mediated relation 
to the complex contests of meaning which comprise culture in the broader 
sense.

Reading Jane Eyre 59 

3.4 Reading Jane Eyre: the critical reception; romance 
and 'self/culture' 

Before reading Jane Eyre it is necessary to say something of the literary culture 
into which it was received. When Thomas Carlyle presented his translation 
of Wilhelm Meister (see section 3.1) to an English/speaking audience in 1824 
he was not hopeful of finding a mass of appreciative readers. Painstaking in 
its representation of a detailed sense of everyday life, particularly Meister's 
artistic education in the theatre, Goethe's narrative was deliberately slow in 
progression: 'Of romance interest there is next to none', Carlyle warned. 
However, for Carlyle this elevated Goethe's offering beyond the expec 
tations of 'the great mass of readers, who read to drive away the tedium of 
mental vacancy, employing the crude phantasmagoria of a modern novel, 
as their grandfathers employed tobacco and diluted brandy'." Novels 
of romantic incident, as Carlyle suggests, were thought to pander to the 
relatively low 'senses'; whereas the novel of education and formation 
appealed to 'thought' and could heighten the reader's own capacity for self- 
cultivation. We should bear these discriminations in mind when reading 
Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, which has seldom been short of enthusiastic or 
even compulsive readers; many have read Jane Eyre 'for pleasure' before they 
are asked to study it academically. Indeed, the novel found many readers and 
generated debate upon publication in 1847. 

In section 2.15, we noted Michael McKeon's point about the way in 
which, by the end of the eighteenth century, many of the explicit debates 
about truth and value in narrative had shifted location from fiction itself to 
the periodical presses and discourses of 'fiction criticism'. By 1847 there 
existed a highly developed system of reviewing which critically evaluated 
the multiplicity of writings, including fiction, in a whole variety of weekly 
and monthly periodical publications. Literary culture, and the discrimi/ 
nations it imparted, were shaped, in large part, by middle/class periodicals 
in the nineteenth century. Some contemporary reviewers of Jane Eyre were 
not slow to recognise the novel's distinctiveness and appeal when it appeared. 
The reviewer for the Atlas (23 October 1847) wrote the following: 

It is one of the most powerful domestic romances which have been published for 
many years. It has little or nothing of the old conventional stamp upon it . . . but 
is full of youthful vigour, of freshness and originality, of nervous diction and 
concentrated interest. The incidents are sometimes mekvdramatic, and, it might 
be added, improbable; but these incidents, though striking, are subordinate 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



60 Bildung and belonging 

to the main purpose of the piece, which depends not upon incident, but on the 
development of character." 

If Wilhelm Meister was short on 'romance', not so Jane Eyre, which the 
reviewer describes as a 'domestic romance'. Reference to domesticity locates 
the novel in the tradition of domestic fiction (see section 2.14), whilst the 
presence of 'romance' and 'mekvdrama' point to the novel's visible attach/ 
ment to popular, sensational conventions. Romance in Jane Eyre is evident 
in two senses: first, at the level of plot, in the vicissitudes of Jane and 
Rochester's love story; and secondly, in the form of apparently supernatural 
incident, manifest in the uncanny happenings at Thornfield Hall. When 
Rochester quizzes Jane about the sighting which made the blood creep 
'cold' through her veins, Jane's reply is derived from the gothic romance (see 
section 2.15); it reminds her of 'the foul German spectre ? the vampire' 
(p. 311). These happenings prefigure the realist switch to melodramatic 
opposition that errupts between Rochester's incarcerated wife Bertha 
Mason, the fleshy, bestial monstrosity, and pure, spiritual Jane. 

But as the reviewer notes, what distinguishes Jane Eyre is the way in which 
the novel participates in these sensational conventions whilst energizing 
them with 'freshness and originality', a distinctiveness generated by 'nervous 
diction', or a strikingly new narrative voice which exudes 'youthful vigour'. 
The emphasis on the narrative voice allows the reviewer to focus on the novel 
as one which foregrounds 'the development of character', a culturally higher 
goal, as we have seen. It is significant that this reviewer should introduce the 
idea of youth, the defining perspective of the bildungsroman: hi Jane Eyre is 
the story of youth's progress, a displaced, alienated and rebellious orphan/ 
child maturing into a young woman who becomes educated, supports 
herself by working as a governess, and marries the landed gentleman she has 
served in this role. As Elizabeth Rigby, reviewing the novel for the Quarterly 
Review, pointed out, this repeats Pamela; but Jane Eyre is a developmental 
story, and is narrated through a very different framework, drawing upon 
quite different discourses. 

3.5 Romantic autobiography and character classification 
in Jane Eyre 

Jane Eyre is, as few will need to be told, a romantic heroine: 

I touched the heath: it was dry, and yet warm with the heat of the summer day. 
I looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star twinkled just above the chasm ridge. 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



Romantic autobiography and character classification 61 

The dew fell, but with propitious softness; no breeze whispered. Nature seemed 
to me benign and good; I thought she loved me, outcast as I was; and I, who 
from man could anticipate only mistrust, rejection, insult, clung to her with filial 
fondness. Tonight, at least, I would be her guest, as I was her child: my mother 
would lodge me without money and without price . . . 

My rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke it. It plained 
of its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven chords, (p. 350) 

Jane is a romantic heroine in one sense because she is fleeing from the 
passionate temptation represented by Mr Rochester: a good example of this 
can be found in Chapter 27 as Jane wrestles with Reason, Feeling and 
Rochester's physicality (pp. 344?5). She is also a romantic subject in the 
sense that, outcast and alienated from corrupt, insincere society, she 
imaginatively embraces, and is embraced by, nature. She imagines nature to 
be benign and good; the heath is, symbolically, an earth mother which 
receives Jane as a child (in later paragraphs, Jane articulates a pantheistic 
view of nature and the universe; pp. 350?1). Finally, Jane's romantic 
identity is confirmed by the emphasis on the first'person T, which is a 
register of her intense subjectivity and tortured inwardness. The question 
that the narrative poses is: how does Jane 'become' this subject? 

When we look at the title page of the first edition of Jane Eyre (the Penguin 
edition of the text reprints it) we see it reads JANE EYRE. / AN 
AUTOBIOGRAPHY / EDITED BY / CURRER BELL (p. 31). 
Even at the point where the novel was an established cultural institution we 
find, in eighteenth/century fashion, Charlotte Bronte's text pretending to be 
something it was not. As we saw in our discussion of Pamela (section 2.8), 
Richardson used the editor convention to frame Pamela's letters. But 
autobiographical conventions produce a very different style of narration 
to the familiar letter and the journal. And the language used by Jane as 
narrator/autobiographer is, as we will see, more varied than Pamela's 
language of sensibility. 

Autobiographical narratives posit two subjects for the reader to interpret: 
the subject who enunciates the narration, and the one who is a character in 
the story told. The latter is a younger version of the former, the former the 
'developed' outcome of the latter. The conventions which construct this 
sense of development are evident in Jane's narrative voice. We become aware 
of it in Chapter 4 when Jane recalls her night'time routine at Gateshead 
Hall: 'It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity I doted 
on this little toy, half fancying it alive and capable of sensation' (p. 61). The 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



62 Bildung and belonging 

subject who enunciates the narration is in possession of mature judgement, 
which is a sign of development and growth. 

It also enables the narrator to reflect on the differences between maturity 
and childhood; when the child Jane is quizzed by Mr Lloyd about her fear 
of ghosts, the narrating Jane comments that 'children can feel, but they 
cannot analyse their feelings; and if the analysis is partly effected in thought, 
they know not how to express the result of the process in words' (p. 56). 
This commentary articulates a theory of character/formation: it assumes 
that feelings (or sensations), thought, analysis and language are separate 
'departments' of the person; and that thought, analysis and language ? the 
language through which the story of one's early life can be narrated and 
analysed ? develop over time, and are rudimentary in the child. 15 

This tendency to classify and objectify is further evident in Jane's reading 
of character, which borrows from the discourse of physiognomy, an ancient 
way of seeing reinvented as a 'science' of character in the late eighteenth cen/ 
tury, which claimed to discern the moral and intellectual worth of people 
from their bodily demeanour, particularly their faces. Thus, when Jane first 
gets the chance to examine Rochester at close quarters she remarks, after 
commenting on his facial features, that 'His shape, now divested of cloak, I 
perceived harmonized in squareness with his physiognomy' (p. 151). 
Rochester attempts to read Jane in the same way just a few pages later. On 
meeting Mr Mason Jane detects 'something in his face that displeased' 
(p. 219); when the exhausted Jane lies 'torpid' beneath St John Rivers's gaze 
she hears him observe '"rather an unusual physiognomy; certainly not in/ 
dicative of vulgarity or degradation" '. Jane's view of Mason's physiognomy 
invites the reader's wariness of this character; St John's words invite the 
reader to share a sense of Jane's uniqueness and moral worth. 

The appropriation of this system of classification and knowledge by 
Bronte and other nineteenth/century novelists was pervasive. Jenny Bourne 
Taylor and Sally Shuttleworth have, in their valuable anthology of nine/ 
teentlvcentury psychological texts, been able to point to the very precise 
connections between the major textbooks of physiognomy, such as George 
Combe's The Constitution of Man (1828), and character description in 
Bronte's fiction. 1 But what is the broader significance of this? In section 3.3 
I established a number of contexts for thinking about the significance of 
the individual in nineteenth/century prose narrative, including the French 
Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars and the Industrial Revolution. The 
French philosopher and historian Michel Foucault has argued that integral

to these grand revolutions of democracy, reason and industrial efficiency was 
a less obvious, but no less profound, reorganisation of social institutions and 
the knowledges and practices which they disseminated (such as schools, 
hospitals, prisons, poor/relief houses and asylums). The aim of this re 
organisation was to rationalise society by disciplining and scientifically 
objectifying human beings into individual 'subjects' bearing various social 
labels (pupils, patients, prisoners, paupers, lunatics, hysterics). 17 This was, 
so to speak, the obverse side of the nature/celebrating inwardness which 
fashions Jane's romantic subjectivity. Such discourses are negotiated during 
the making of Jane's self. 

3.6 Space, time and subjectivity in Jane Eyre 

The narrator juggles between genres in telling her story. As Jane says at the 
beginning of Chapter 10, 'this is not to be a regular autobiography: I am 
only bound to invoke memory where I know her responses will possess some 
degree of interest; therefore I now pass a space of eight years almost in 
silence' (p. 115). We established in section 3.2 the point that 'biographical 
time' is always a cultural convention; here the narrator's concern with the 
'lessons' of self-culture delivered through autobiography is tempered by the 
implied author's recognition of the implied reader's anticipated pleasures, 
which call for Jane to be less of an autobiographer, more of a novelistic 
narrator, and character, and heroine. The implied author thus grants 
the narrative voice flexible powers, enabling Jane to be, at various stages, 
narrator, objectified character (see p. 323) and speaking heroine (see p. 344), 
as well as autobiographer. The point that we can make here is that Jane's 
subjectivity is being constructed and reconstructed as the narrative shifts 
from one focus of spatial attention to the next. Different phases of Jane's self- 
formation are narrated in the domestic space of Gateshead Hall, the institu/ 
tional space of Lowood school, and the gothic space of Thornfield Hall. 

At the beginning of the novel the orphan Jane has no legitimacy in the 
middle/class domestic space of the Reed household; she is branded a 
'dependant' who is 'less than a servant' because she does not work for her 
keep (p. 44). These details highlight the extent to which a scene of 'everyday 
life', the middle/class household, has its familiarity stripped away and is 
shown to operate on the basis of moral and utilitarian classifications with 
exclusionary and disciplinary effects (we can contrast this with Pamela, in 
which everyday domestic space is also shown to be oppressive, but in 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



64 Bildung and belonging 

Pamela's case because of Mr B.'s seigneurial rights). Consequently, Jane 
Eyre recalls and objectifies her marginal status in the language of otherness: 
'I sat, cross/legged like a Turk' (p. 39); 'like any other rebel slave, I felt 
resolved, in my desperation, to go to all lengths' (p. 44); and, locked in the 
Red Room and looking in the mirror, the narrator sees staring back an image 
'like one of the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp' (p. 46). Using oriental 
and gothic discourses, and the language of tyranny and subjection, Jane 
constructs herself as an excluded and persecuted rebel'child, with no rights, 
only obligations which must be met to avoid incarceration in the institution 
of the poorhouse (p. 44). 

Whilst Jane avoids the poorhouse, she is sent to Lowood Institution, the 
evangelical Mr Brocklehurst's charity school for orphans. Lowood is a 
school which is emblematic of Foucault's case for the disciplinary turn 
which characterised nineteenth/century institutions. Governed by the clock, 
passing time is marked by carefully regulated activities and surveillance: 
'A chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and the 
girls examined ... The play hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest 
fraction of the day at Lowood' (p. 86) .'Discipline prevailed', and girls sit 
erect in ranks, wearing brown uniforms, under the gaze of teachers (pp. 
78?9). Punishment is meted out in public at Lowood, dramatised in Helen 
Burns's stoic endurance of corporal punishment, humiliation and victim/ 
isation. Jane is subject to similar public punishment, but this is narrated in 
far from negative terms which make clear the inner resources that Jane draws 
from this episode: 

There was I, then, mounted aloft: I, who had said I could not bear the shame of 
standing on my natural feet in the middle of the room, was now exposed to 
general view on a pedestal of infamy. What my sensations were no language can 
describe; but just as they all rose stifling my breath and constricting my throat, a 
girl came up and passed me: in passing, she lifted her eyes. What a strange light 
inspired them! What extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me! How the 
new feeling bore me up! It was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave or victim, 
and imparted strength in the transit. I mastered the rising hysteria, lifted up my 
head, and took a firm stand on the stool, (p. 99) 

The glance that Jane receives ? it is from Helen Burns ? marks the transition 
from 'rising hysteria' to control of the sensations and the imposition of self- 
mastery. We can see then that this public punishment ? measured and 
regulated in time ('"Let her stand half an hour longer on that stool, and let 
no one speak to her during the remainder of the day" ') ? is a formative event 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



Space, time and subjectivity in Jane Eyre 65 

in the fashioning of Jane's subjectivity. Having been objectified and shamed 
as a 'deviant', she uses a discourse of heroism to fashion a liberating inward/ 
ness. As Foucault has argued, the objectification of individuals is just one 
side of the process he has mapped: techniques of self-'subjectification', 
usually shaped by narrative forms such as confessions and autobiographies, 
are important sources of resistance, as we see here. 18 It is notable that Miss 
Temple, the teacher with whom Jane identifies, encourages Jane to tell her 
life story for the first time at Lowood. 

By contrast, gothic conventions are introduced to signify a crisis in the 
formation of Jane's subjectivity during the Thornfield Hall chapters, which 
bring the simultaneous discoveries of sexual desire for Rochester and the 
existence in the attic of her monstrous 'rival', Bertha Mason: both 
discoveries present individual imagination with unbridled opportunities. In 
the previous chapter (section 2.15) I briefly discussed the late eighteenth/ 
century gothic 'revival' in fiction. Even though the heyday of the gothic 
romance was the 1790s, the form donated a repertoire of conventions which 
were recycled throughout the nineteenth century and beyond. The opening 
of Chapter 20 gives us a good instance of the effects of the gothic in Jane 
Eyre: the action takes place at night ? 'sleep and night had resumed their 
empire' (p. 237) ? by the light of the moon which streams in through the 
open blind; frightening and inexplicable sounds errupt from the house: 
'terrified murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed' 
(p. 235). Elsewhere in this central portion of the novel Thornfield's gothic 
decadence is further registered through Jane's experience of, on the one 
hand, Blanche Ingram's aristocratic disdain and, on the other, Rochester's 
cynicism and dark, ambiguous machinations. 

And yet Jane's inwardness and self-control overcome this: as Rochester 
remonstrates with her, threatening violence as she makes to depart after the 
revelation of Bertha's existence, Jane narrates: 

I saw that in another moment, and with one impetus of frenzy more, I should be 
able to do nothing with him. The present ? the passing second of time ? was all 
I had in which to control and restrain him: a movement of repulsion, flight, fear 
would have sealed my doom ? and his. But I was not afraid, not in the least. I 
felt an inward power, a sense of influence, which supported me. (p. 330) 

Here time is presented as the drama of the moment, 'the passing second of 
time'. I noted in section 2.15 that the gothic places a strong emphasis on the 
immediate sensations of fear, desire and pain that characters experience. An 
example of this occurs in Chapter 17 when Jane's narration shifts to the

present tense ? 'He comes in at last; I am not looking at the arch, yet I see 
him enter' ? and she records the 'pleasure' and 'agony' of desire as she 
gazes at Rochester (p. 203). But in the passage above the emphasis is on 
Rochester's loss of control, and it is Jane who can now exercise restraint 
upon others: though not by physical means; instead on the basis of her 
'inward power, a sense of influence which supported me'. The precise 
significance of this will be discussed in section 3.7, but we can see why 
Elizabeth Rigby saw similarities between Jane Eyre and Pamela. 

3.7 Where docs Jane Eyre belong? 

This question is double-edged, as we shall see. The simple answer, when we 
reply with reference to Jane's character, is with Rochester, of course. Jane 
may flee from Rochester and the shameful prospect of being his mistress, but 
she rejects the controlling, evangelical missionary zeal of St John Rivers 
to return to Rochester, who has become blind, crippled and widowed in 
her absence. As readers know, she marries him, and thus finds a sense of 
belonging. When we answer the question in relation to the novel and the 
conventions and discourses it deploys to create and cohere Jane's subjectivity, 
the reply is more complex. For Jane's 'development' and marriage negotiate 
a tension between gothic romance and domestic realism. 

We have seen how the novel uses gothic conventions for narrating the 
fraught and embattled place of imagination and individual desire in the 
formation of Jane's subjectivity. The feminist critic Ellen Moers has argued 
that the conventions of gothic supernaturalism acquired significance as a 
discourse which nineteenth/century women writers used in their struggle to 
articulate a protest against their subordinate position in existing gender 
relations. 19 Such a protest is actually articulated by Jane, recollecting her 
sense of wanting more as she ascends, symbolically, beyond the 'haunted' 
attic of Thornfield: 'women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their 
faculties ... they suffer from too rigid a restraint' (p. 141). 

But Jane's continued cultivation of 'inward power' in the form of a 'sense 
of influence' (see section 3.6) signals an important stage in her development, 
for it marks her transition from romantic heroine to potential middle/class 
wife and domestic manager. In section 2.14 I sketched Nancy Armstrong's 
thesis regarding the significance of domestic discourse for the history of the 
novel and English cultural hegemony in the modern period. The idea of 
moral 'influence' was an extension of this: a nineteenth/century code for

precisely this kind of delimited female power, which was supposed to tame 
and restrain the wild, competitive, worldly tendencies of the male through 
the civilising virtues of domesticity. It is the autobiographical character 
of the narrative which presents Jane's 'realist' domestic subjectivity as 
victorious over romantic individualism and gothic imagination, the final 
viewpoint which Jane casts on her own turbulent history and historical 
turbulence in general. 

Feminist scholars and critics have, in recent years, made persuasive claims 
hi Jane Eyre as a complex contribution to a tradition of women's writing. 20 
At the same time, they have argued vigorously about its meaning. Whilst 
the novel does not make Jane subordinate to Rochester ? the source of 
Rochester's worldliness, his physicality, is shattered, and Jane's inheritance 
makes her financially independent ? there are still tensions. For instance, 
how is the monstrous Bertha Mason to be accommodated and explained 
by an inclusive feminist politics and its imagined community? Indeed, as 
Gayatri Spivak has argued from a postcolonial feminist perspective (post/ 
colonialism will be explored in more depth in Chapter 5), Bertha's creole 
status 'naturalises' her monstrosity and marks the Eurocentric exclusiveness 
of the Western feminist project. 21 This is confirmed by the closing para/ 
graphs of Jane's narrative, in which she reports, approvingly, of St John 
Rivers, now a missionary in India, 'hew[ing] ... down the prejudices of 
creed and caste' (p. 477). What is unacceptable for Jane herself is positively 
advocated for the subjects of empire. 

We could say that present/day feminist criticism, itself a politically and 
intellectually complex field of debate, confronts in Jane Eyre a narrative 
which is discursively complex, nuanced, multi'layered and open to many 
interpretations. For some critics in the late 1840s it was not at all obvious that 
they were dealing with 'women's writing'; we need to recall that at this point 
readers only knew the author of Jane Eyre as 'Currer Bell', a name which 
could have been male or female. 22 Robert Lorimer in the North British Review 
remarked that 'Jane Eyre strikes us as a personage much more likely to have 
sprung ready armed from the head of a man, and that head a pretty hard 
one, than to have experienced, in any shape, the softening influence of female 
creation.' " Clearly this says much about gendered critical prejudices in the 
1840s, but it was the case that in its allusions to 'millions ... in silent revolt 
against their lot' (p. 141), and its representation of Jane's famished begging 
as she flees from Thornfield (p. 355), the novel could be read as a radical 
address on behalf of the excluded and discontented everywhere.

Elizabeth Rigby's hostile review for the Tory Quarterly Review saw it 
precisely this way: instead of focusing on Jane's reaffirmation of the 
domestic ideal, Rigby saw Jane's viewpoint on history as one which arose 
out of the revolutionary social turbulence which marked the opening 
decades of the nineteenth century, and which reached a crisis point in 1848, 
the year of European revolutions (see section 3.3). For Rigby, Jane Eyre was 
an 'ami' Christian composition ... a proud and perpetual assertion of the 
rights of man . . . We do not hesitate to say that the tone of mind and thought 
which has overthrown authority and violated every code human and divine 
abroad, and fostered Chartism and rebellion at home, is the same which has 
also written Jane Eyre.' 24 Rigby's hostility to subversiveness apparently owed 
something to the rumour passed to her by J. G. Lockhart, editor of the 
Quarterly: he had heard that Currer Bell, along with his brothers Ellis and 
Acton, were Lancashire weavers. 25 I want now to turn to the 1840s auto/ 
biographical writings of Samuel Bamford, who was from Lancashire and 
was formerly a weaver. For in the nineteenth century, select working/class 
men recorded their viewpoint on history, and expressed the extent of their 
self-cultivation, through acts of autobiographical writing. 

3.8 Reading Samuel Bamford's Early Days: the common 
narrative strategies of autobiography and novel 

Samuel Bamford wrote two first/person narratives about his life: Passages 
in the Life of a Radical (1842), an account of Bamford's radical political 
activities and imprisonment for alleged treason following the period of post/ 
Waterloo political agitation (1815-19); and Early Days (1847), an account 
of his childhood and youth in Lancashire. Given this chapter's concern 
with the bildungsroman, I shall focus on Bamford's Early Days. 

I have demonstrated in my analysis of Jane Eyre some of the formal 
properties of autobiographical narration which generate signs of develop/ 
ment linking past and present selves with varying degrees of coherence and 
continuity. We find similar strategies at work in Early Days. In an early 
episode, Bamford narrates the story of his impoverished mother's visit to her 
wealthy sister in Manchester, the rebuff she receives, and the long walk 
home to Middleton in the rain: 

The recollection of my heart/wounded, but noble/minded and forgiving 
mother, as she suffered under that trial, is still vividly before me; and never, I 
believe, will it be obliterated from my memory until consciousness remains. Ever

'Reality is always romantic' 69 

since I had the faculty for reasoning on these recollections I have cherished an 
unmitigatable contempt for mere money pride, (p. 31) 

There are notable parallels with Jane Eyre here. The autobiographer 
accounts for his development into a political and moral radical through the 
image of his mother, who is excluded from a share in the fruits of the world 
because of middle/class pride. The narrator's mother has undergone a 
prejudiced 'trial', so that the episode is recollected in the kind of juridical 
discourse which is such a pronounced feature of the protests that pervade 
Jane Eyre: '"Unjust! ? unjust!" said my reason' (p. 47). We can see why 
Elizabeth Rigby thought that Jane Eyre spoke in the common tongue of 
radical discontent. 

There is also in this extract from Early Days an embedded associationist 
theory of character development which narrates the inevitability of the 
autobiographer's moral stance: the impression is powerfully inscribed on the 
mind, it becomes memory, and the developing faculty of reason sets to work 
on these recollections. 26 Clearly, nineteenth/century autobiographies and 
novels could draw on similar psychological and philosophical discourses 
when accounting for character/formation. What are we to make of this 
insight? How does it affect the authority of autobiography and its claims to 
'truthfulness'? 

3.9 'Reality is always romantic, though the romantic is 
not always real': the truth of autobiography 

Autobiography is classified as non/fiction prose: the life it narrates or 
confesses to is that of the person who wrote it. Yet it is made of the same 
basic narrative material as the fictional novel (as noted in section 2.11, early 
examples of the novel as practised by Defoe presented themselves as truthful, 
confessional narratives). Accordingly, questions of veracity are often to the 
fore in the reading and discussion of autobiography. Autobiographers are 
usually the first to raise them: reflecting on the fact that his autobiography 
may emphasise the darker, more sombre episodes in his life, Bamford assures 
the reader that 'there may be some strong clouding here and there. There 
must be if truth and nature are adhered to, and from them we assuredly will 
not depart' (p. 51). At the same time as asserting the truth of his narrative, 
we can see from the quotation which heads this section (Early Days, p. 339) 
that Bamford conceded that there was also a 'romantic', or imaginative and 
figurative, dimension to this truth. Literary critics and cultural historians 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Page 



70 Bildung and belonging 

have, therefore, had to concern themselves with complex approaches to truth 
in autobiography. 

In an attempt to devise a non/essentialist framework which might help to 
establish the 'truth' of an autobiographical text, the literary critic Elizabeth 
Bruss advocates a pragmatic, 'institutional' theory of the autobiographical 
genre. To this end she formulates a number of 'rules' which regulate the 
relationship between reader, text and autobiographer. One rule states that 
the existence of the individual who is autobiographer is independent of the 
text itself, and assumed to be susceptible to appropriate public verification 
procedures. 27 It is certainly the case that any reader of 1847 who went in 
search of the independent existence of Samuel Bamford would have had 
more success than a reader who sought out Jane Eyre: Bamford's social and 
political identity was in the public domain: he was, amongst other things, 
Manchester correspondent of the Morning Herald, and the writer Elizabeth 
Gaskell managed to locate him in order to deliver a volume of Tennyson's 
poems in 1849. 28 

But we cannot expect this rule to answer a different question. The 
question of Bamford's existence leaves aside the issue of the way in which 
Bamford's autobiographical text works to create effects of truthfulness. The 
impulse to verification that readers may feel is not so appropriate in this 
regard, even given Bamford's manifest desire to refer the reader to settings 
and objects in the community of Middleton: 

Beginning with the church, thou must know that externally it was in much 
the same state as at present. Internally, the chapel of the Asshetons would be 
somewhat different. The staircase mounting to that piece of 'pride' in a place of 
'humility', the Suffield's pew, did not then cover up and obscure the grave/stone 
of Colonel Assheton, who commanded the Parliamentary forces of Lancashire 
during the Civil War of the Commonwealth, (p. 41) 

This is very characteristic of Bamford's style in Early Days; in the way that 
relations of contiguity between objects are established in the quotation 
above, the autobiography begins with a genealogy which contextualises the 
narrator's place in the family history. It is very different from, for example, 
the first two paragraphs which open Jane Eyre, in which the action begins in 
meiias res, and the isolation of the narrator is dramatised by contrasting use 
of pronouns ('we '/'I'). In addition, the grounds of Gateshead Hall figure 
incidentally as 'leafless shrubbery', creating the sense that place is subsumed 
into the barren, emotionally undernourished mood of the narrator (p. 39). 
For Bamford, place is described for itself, and its sense of actuality is created 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Page 



'Reality is always romantic' 71 

by a strategic 'that', which predicates 'Suffield's pew'. 'That' is an instance 
of what linguists call deixis, by which means the text employs a demon/ 
strative to 'point' to something apparently outside itself. 

However, deixis is not necessarily an invitation to verify; its use at the 
beginning of George Eliot's The Mill on the Floss constructs a sense of im/ 
mediacy with no extra/textual reference: 'And this is Dorlcote Mill. I must 
stand a minute or two here on the bridge and look at it' (p. 55). Indeed, an 
excessive emphasis on verification misrecognises the reading relations into 
which we are invited. For deixis works together with direct address to the 
reader who is comfortable with archaisms; 'thou must know'. Bamford's 
address here implies a reader who belongs to his community and shares its 
sense of history: deixis rhetorically strengthens the imaginary bond. This 
anticipated identification is underpinned by what seem to be incidental 
details, but which are actually rich, and require a figurative interpretation 
grounded in culture and history. The fact that Colonel Assheton's tomb 
has been 'obscured' by the Suffield family's elevated private pew figuratively 
implies the view that the course of English history since Bamford's child/ 
hood has been dominated by the selfish creation of wealth, obscuring the 
Parliamentary victories of the Civil War which Assheton, in the name of 
liberty and the commonwealth, helped to lead; the archaic form of address 
to the reader perhaps indicates a romantic attitude towards a lost radical past 
which is being obliterated by a rapacious modernity. 

Where does this leave the question of the truth of autobiography? Even 
though deixis is no guarantee of extra/textual reference, we still have respon/ 
sibilities to seek to contextualise realistic details which turn out to have a 
romantic inflection. For instance, Bamford's sense of his audience for Early 
Days, and his consequent use of direct address and deixis, may have been 
shaped by the knowledge that subscriptions were raised in the Manchester 
area to help towards the cost of publication; costs that were borne by the 
London/based but nationally networked commercial publishing house 
owned by George Smith in the case of Jane Eyre. 2 '' 

Contexts are also linguistic, and can be inferred through textual details. 
Even if Bamford's autobiography casts a figurative inflection on its subject 
matter, this in no way diminishes the cultural significance that such subject 
matter imparts. Indeed, different emphases within ostensibly similar figur/ 
ations can point to important social and cultural differences between a novel 
by a middle/class woman and an autobiography by a working/class man. 
Thus, whilst Jane Eyre praises and validates the virtues of work and in/ 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Page 



72 Bildung and belonging 

dependence, it is Bamford's prose which describes in detail particular 
processes of work experienced in the course of a working life (see Chapter 
25 of Early Days, entitled 'Warehouse Work Again'). And whilst both texts 
present the experience of love as being central to self-formation, they employ 
very different gendered conventions for narrating it. We saw in section 3.6 
the place of the gothic in Bronte's Jane Eyre, and considered the gender 
politics it encoded for the nineteenth/century woman writer. By contrast, 
Bamford's Early Days contains a chapter entitled 'Love's Dawnings', and 
this key rite of passage in the narrative of self-formation takes its shape, 
language and intense introspective stance from Goethe's highly influential 
representation of male romantic love, The Sorrows of Young Werther (1774); 
'I now became moody and melancholy, brooding over my ill success in 
courtship, and wondering how it happened that love like mine should go 
unrequited' (p. 181). 

Non/fictional and fictional prose narratives consequently perform their 
sense of cultural belonging and alignment by virtue of the way in which 
they borrow conventions and idioms from different literary traditions. Early 
Days also weaves the supernatural into its narrative, but to rather different 
effect to that achieved by the use of the gothic supernatural in Jane Eyre. 
Bamford narrates in elaborate detail the superstitions and traditions of 
hauntings that surround Middleton, including one in which the presence of 
his mother's ghost is reported to him by his aunts. In its handling of this 
story, Bamford's autobiography announces a divided sense of belonging. 
Bamford represents his aunts' account of the sighting of his dead mother in 
direct'Speech Lancashire dialect: '"I knew her the moment I set my een on 
her. Hoos comn fro' heaven, and hoo's gooin back theer" ' (p. 146). Bamford 
represents his reply to the aunts by dramatising himself as a character in his 
own story. Addressing them through reported speech, he agrees with his 
aunts' sense of the 'haunting' quality of the place at which his mother's 
ghost has apparently been seen, but he does so in a register which implies a 
rather different kind of reader: 

'Well, I cannot tell how it happens aunt, but I always feel so calm and soothed 
when at dusk I walk alone round the green, or sit on the bright grass under the 
trees. It seems as if I had all the company I desire: I can converse better with 
myself, as it were ? can commune more deeply with my own feelings and 
thoughts in that lone spot than in any other ... I shall go there oftener.' (p. 147) 

With its emphasis on the relationship between nature and solitary inward/ 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Page 



Reading Gaskell's Life of Charlotte Bronte 73 

ness, Bamford's character speaks in the literary language of romantic sub/ 
jectivity, much as we saw in the case of Jane Eyre in section 3.5. Figuratively, 
Bamford's autobiographical narrative has one foot in working/class Middle/ 
ton, and another in Manchester's polite, literary culture. In a sense, literacy 
is a major subject in Bamford's life story (bios), and he narrates in some 
detail his self-education in reading. The literary language that Bamford has 
acquired provides a naturalistic sense of what it means to be haunted, which 
side/steps 'superstitious' belief in the actuality of the ghost. For Bamford, to 
be haunted is to commune and converse introspectively with the self. The 
'journey' of self-education that Bamford has undertaken is performed at this 
moment, for to write in this way is an expressive sign of Bamford's cultivated 
and autonomous self (autos). However, this autonomous, solitary self is 
constructed through narrative: in practice the different registers and idioms 
of Bamford's autobiography suggest a viewpoint on his own life history 
which was divided between multiple sources of belonging. 



3.10 Reading Elizabeth Gaskell's The Life of Charlotte 
Bronte: the rhetoric of biography 

It is now commonplace to read fane Eyre autobiographically: Jane Eyre's 
experience at Lowood appears to have its source in Charlotte Bronte's 
unhappy time at Cowan Bridge school in West Yorkshire. Yet, as I noted in 
section 3.7, following the initial pseudonymous publication of fane Eyre, 
metropolitan literary intellectuals pondered rumours about the true identity 
of its author (it was rumoured that 'Currer Bell' was a male Lancashire 
weaver). For Charlotte Bronte's life to become public knowledge, it needed 
a biography: this was published in 1857 by Elizabeth Gaskell as The Life of 
Charlotte Bronte. Understandably, students of literature use biographies as 
tools, to be consulted as authoritative sources of scholarship. Biographers 
strive, on the basis of documentary and (where available) oral evidence, to 
reconstruct the chronological events comprising their subject's life and its 
meanings as accurately and dispassionately as possible. Elizabeth Gaskell's 
biography of Charlotte Bronte was researched and based on evidence. 

Like autobiographies, biographies are narratives. Consequently, their 
transparency and objectivity can be demonstrated and accepted only to 
a point. As narratives, biographies are figuratively rich texts which are 
enmeshed with discourses of culture and, implicitly, participants in debates 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Page 



74 Bildung and belonging 

about the direction of culture. Elizabeth Gaskell's biography of Charlotte 
Bronte participates in a nineteenth/century cultural debate about the appro/ 
priateness of writing as a womanly vocation. As narratives, biographies 
represent characters and systems of evaluation made from the discourses also 
used by novels. For example, in Elizabeth Gaskell's The Life of Charlotte 
Bronte, discourses of physiognomy (see section 3.5) figure in the represen/ 
tation of character: in an extended description of Charlotte's appearance, 
the biographer recalls that her eyes gave access to inwardness 'as if some 
spiritual lamp had been kindled' (p. 76). It is the same physiognomical 
classification which accounts for her brother Branwell Bronte's character 
failings: 'there are coarse lines about the mouth, and the lips, though of 
handsome shape, are loose and thick, indicating self-indulgence, while the 
slightly retreating chin conveys an idea of weakness of will' (p. 146). In 
common with the first/person bildung narratives we have explored so far, 
Elizabeth Gaskell's biography narrates her subject's growth and develop/ 
ment, taking childhood as the formative starting point: when Gaskell 
estimates an incident's 'effect upon the character of Charlotte Bronte', she 
urges the reader that 'we must remember that she was a sensitive and 
thoughtful child, capable of reflecting deeply, if not analysing truly' (p. 60). 
This is strikingly similar to the 'developmental' hypothesis in Jane Eyre 
which stated that 'children can feel, but they cannot analyse their feelings' 
(see section 3.5). 

However, nineteenth/century biography often casts a quite different 
viewpoint on youth and formation because the motive for the writing resides 
in the subject's death. Readers are seldom allowed to forget that Charlotte is 
no more. The opening chapter, for instance, transcribes the inscription on 
Charlotte's gravestone; later on the biographer refers to the scrapbook of 
reviews of Jane Eyre, each review 'cut out and carefully ticketed with its date 
by the poor bereaved father, ? so proud when he first read them ? so desolate 
now' (p. 264). 

The implied reader's response to this is shaped by a particular kind of 
address. So far in this chapter we have been reading first/person prose 
narratives, even though the narrator or autobiographer (Active or actual) 
frequently narrates her or himself as a character in the story. In reading a 
biography ? and even though therein we may read personal letters, or 
extracts from a journal ? our response is shaped by a biographer; that is, a 
narrator who speaks of and for the memory of the central subject of the 
narrative in the third person. There is often a rhetorical purpose to this form 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Page 



Reading Gaskell's Life of Charlotte Bronte 75 

of address, exemplified towards the end of Elizabeth Gaskell's narrative 
when she declares that 'to [the] Public I commit the memory of Charlotte 
Bronte' (p. 457). There are three points that we can pick up here which 
characterise biographical narrative: rhetoric, the invocation of memory, and 
the concept of the public, all of which are linked. 

As we saw in Chapter 1, rhetoric has a persuasive function. Aristotle 
distinguished between three kinds of rhetoric: deliberative, forensic and 
epideictic. The first two were effective in the political and legal spheres 
respectively. The third, epideictic, was much wider ranging, classifying and 
codifying, for example, ways of articulating a panegyric, or encomium, or a 
funeral oration which emphasised to good effect the virtues of the person 
being spoken of (as we saw in section 3.2, for Bakhtin this kind of rhetoric 
generated the earliest forms of biography). 30 Rhetorical forms may of course 
be present in the novel and autobiography; indeed, Jane Eyre's address to 
the reader pleading the cause of the 'millions ... in silent revolt against their 
lot' (p. 141) could be categorised as a blend of deliberative and epideictic 
rhetoric. So too could Bamford's apostrophe to English labour in Early Days: 
'Promote honest labour. Honour it wherever or however found. Have 
respect to the horny hand and the dewey forehead' (p. 210). In looking at 
biography, however, we are looking at a genre in which epideictic rhetoric, 
or the determination to persuade the public that the subject of the biography 
had led a good life, is a strong, framing presence. 

It is significant that the subject's death and the memorial function of 
biography should be invoked in connection with public reactions to 
her writings, and the representation of private, family grief, for Gaskell's 
biography undertakes to make the private life of Charlotte Bronte known to 
the public. The first important modern biography in English was James 
Boswell's Life of Samuel fohnson (1791). Boswell's text was framed by the 
rhetorical impulse to defend and vindicate the memory of Samuel Johnson 
as a virtuous public man, in spite of his coarse and uncouth manner; and 
to claim for him the status of preeminent authority in literary culture. 
Victorian biographies of writers were at once justifications of the kinds of 
life that their subjects led, and assessments of their place in, and degree of 
belonging to, literary culture. Consequently, Elizabeth Gaskell works in the 
characteristic manner of the modern biographer after Boswell, commem/ 
orating Charlotte Bronte by showing to the public her character as revealed 
in private letters and testimonies of those who knew her. Charlotte Bronte's 
letters often take the form either of narratives or of journaHike exercises for

76 Bildung and belonging 

self-exploration (see for instance pp. 163?4), which 'show her character' 
(p. 266) as Gaskell remarks. 

But installing a character in the public sphere is a potentially controversial 
activity which shapes, and exploits, the specific rhetorical traits of biography. 
More specifically still, we have to acknowledge another manifestation of 
gendered domestic ideology as one of the factors that made a woman biogra/ 
pher's account of Charlotte Bronte as a private woman and public writer 
much more difficult to shape and place before 'the public'. 

3.11 Biography, gender and the public position of the 
woman writer: negotiating 'realism' and 'romance' 

I observed in section 3.7 that Jane Eyre has come to be seen as an important 
contribution to a tradition of women's novel writing. Elizabeth Gaskell's 
biography of Charlotte Bronte helped to promote it as such, in that it raised 
the question of the public status of the woman writer. The epigraph which 
Gaskell attached to the title page of her narrative clearly signifies this: it is 
from Elizabeth Barrett Browning's poem Aurora Leigh (1857) which was 
about a woman poet and had plot similarities to Jane Eyre. The lines: '"Oh 
My God, / ? Thou hast knowledge, only Thou, / How dreary 'tis for 
women to sit still / On winter nights by solitary fires / And hear the nations 
praising them far off".' Ann Marie Ross has drawn attention to what may 
be described, following critics such as Elaine Showalter, as the gynocentric 
strategies and rhythms of novelistic narration which Gaskell ? a significant 
woman novelist in her own right ? wove into her memorial of another 
woman writer. Ross concludes that 'Gaskell viewed Bronte as a member of 
a "community of women" artists', which makes a strong claim about the 
terms of literary belonging that Gaskell asserts, jointly, for Charlotte Bronte 
and her own biographical account of Bronte's character/formation. 31 At 
the same time, the lines from Barrett Browning are about the constraints 
imposed on women by domestic confinement, and suggest something of the 
difficulty that Elizabeth Gaskell faced in writing a public account of the life 
of a woman who, imaginatively at least, sought to break with powerful 
social conventions. 

I argued in section 3.10 that biographies are narratives which at some 
level rhetorically justify the moral lives of their subjects and, in the case of

public, had to confront a domestic ideology which held that leading the life 
of a good woman was incompatible with being a writer. This ideology is set 
out clearly in Robert Southey's reply to Charlotte Bronte's request for a 
writer's advice on the vocation of writing, which Elizabeth Gaskell includes 
in her narrative: Southey opines that 'the more she is engaged in her proper 
[domestic] duties, the less leisure she will have for it [writing]' (p. 123). 

This ideology frames the biographer's account of Charlotte Bronte's 
writing habits: 

Sometimes weeks or even months elapsed before she felt she had anything to add 
to that portion of her story which was already written. Then, some morning she 
would waken up, and the progress of her tale lay clear and bright before her, in 
distinct vision. When this was the case, all her care was to discharge her house/ 
hold and filial duties, so as to obtain leisure to sit down and write out the inci- 
dents and consequent thoughts which were, in fact, more present to her mind at 
such times than her actual life itself. Yet notwithstanding this 'possession' (as it 
were), those who survive, of her daily and household companions, are clear 
in their testimony, that never was the claim of any duty, never was the call of 
another for help, neglected for an instant, (pp. 245?6) 

We might note here that the authority for this account rests with the 'clear 
testimony' of domestic witnesses, so the biographer's rhetoric stresses evi' 
dence and actuality. This allows the biographer to negotiate the proscription 
on women's writing by domestic ideology: Charlotte Bronte was both a 
good, self-sacrificing domestic woman and a writer. But we need to look 
carefully at the terms that the biographer uses to describe Bronte's mental 
state when writing, because they carry resonant cultural evaluations: 'fie/ 
tions' are 'more present to her mind ... than her actual life itself, which 
is tantamount to '"possession"'. In other words, Bronte was haunted by 
an imagination that was in tension with, even if it did not disrupt, the 
workaday world of domestic responsibility. The biographer is working 
with an opposition between 'romance' and 'realism'. These underpin the 
biographer's construction of the divisions and conflicts between the roles of 
domestic woman and romantic woman writer: 

Henceforward Charlotte Bronte's existence becomes divided into two parallel 
currents ? her life as Currer Bell, the author; her life as Charlotte Bronte, the 
woman. There were separate duties belonging to each character ? not opposing 
each other; not impossible, but difficult to be reconciled, (p. 271) 

As in the case of Samuel Bamford, cultural conflict and tension divide the 
terms on which Charlotte Bronte belongs to a community.

This has led the feminist literary critic Deirdre D'Albertis to read 
Gaskell's biography of Charlotte Bronte as a comment on divisions which 
had broader implications for the direction and purpose of narrative itself, 
both fictional and non/fictional. According to D'Albertis, there is a funda/ 
mental difference between Bronte and Gaskell as novelists: Charlotte 
Bronte's tendency to privilege introspective, tortured, romantic subjectivities 
was not shared by Elizabeth Gaskell, whose novels adopted an external 
viewpoint and sought to dramatise shared suffering, and thereby to spread 
sympathy in an imagined community, exemplified in Mary Barton (1848) 
and North and South (1855). Both novels narrate the social suffering brought 
about by industrial society and the conflict between social classes to which 
it gives rise; Gaskell's third/person narration seeks to represent the points of 
view of these classes and to generate understanding and sympathy between 
them. D'Albertis argues that 'If Bronte embraced the blending of narrator 
and heroine in her fiction, Gaskell . . . preferred the detachment and control 
exercised by the writer of others' lives.' " Gaskell's biography of the intro/ 
spective Bronte can be read as enacting the triumph of Gaskell's convictions 
about the true value of narrative: its capacity to demonstrate the judgemental 
and sympathetic power of 'realism' over introspective 'romance'. This read/ 
ing of Elizabeth Gaskell's Life of Charlotte Bronte, as a form of non/fictional 
prose narrative which implicitly contributed to a debate about the continu/ 
ing refinement of the cultural functions of narrative at times of profound 
change, brings us to the novels of, arguably, the most important English 
novelist of the nineteenth century, George Eliot (Marian Evans). 



3.12 Reading George Eliot's The Mill on the Floss: 
culture as 'incarnate history' 

George Eliot's The Mill on the Floss was published in 1860. Set in the 
provincial England of the 1820s, it tells the story of the long/established 
Tulliver family, millers who possess but then disastrously are dispossessed of 
Dorlcote Mill by processes of change which the head of the family no longer 
understands. Its main drama is concerned with the youth, formation 
and tragic end of the brother and sister characters, the practical and un/ 
imaginative Tom and the romantic, spontaneous Maggie; it is another 
example of the bildungsroman in which romance collides with realism. In 
many respects George Eliot's formal narrative practice resembles Elizabeth

Reading George Eliot's The Mill on the Floss 79 

Gaskell's (and indeed Jane Austen's), given its use of the third/person voice 
and its realist preference for the management of subordinate character voices 
to generate appropriate measures of 'sympathy'. In outline such practices are 
accounted for in Ian Watt's idea of 'realism of assessment', which he applied 
to the narrative methods of Fielding (see section 2.12). But by the middle of 
the nineteenth century, and in George Eliot's hands, realist fiction embraced 
more ambitious intellectual discourses and social aims, which were first 
articulated in Eliot's journalistic work. 

It is in this context that we should read Marian Evans's 'The Natural 
History of German Life', a review of a book of German ethnography and 
sociology which appeared in 1856 in the Westminster Review, two years 
before she began to publish fiction under the name of 'George Eliot'. This 
review essay explores the role of artistic narratives in generating 'sympathy' 
and mutual understanding between disparate communities in the context of 
a rapidly changing society and class structure. For although the essay is about 
peasant life in central Europe, it begins by reflecting on the modernising 
phenomenon of the railways in Britain, which connected communities 
geographically whilst dividing them socially. The essayist notes that the 
word 'railway' would be likely to generate very different associations to 
people of different social classes, depending on whether they were working 
navvies who had built the structures, or middle/class people who used them 
for speedy travel (p. 260). 33 

The essay explores the 'character' type of the German peasantry, especially 
its unbending obligation to family ties, and 'its inveterate habit of litigation' 
(p. 272). These concerns indicate the extent to which the essay is under/ 
pinned by a so/called 'anthropological' understanding of 'culture', or the 
total way of life of a particular community. This anthropological discourse 
about 'culture' became increasingly authoritative as the century progressed, 
in large part because of the emergence of scientific anthropological work 
on 'primitive' societies and the 'evidence' it yielded about evolutionary 
developments towards advanced civilisation. 34 At the same time, a strong 
sense of cultures and communities as 'incarnate history' was already 
established as yet another legacy of romanticism ? particularly German 
Romanticism ? and its interest in the archaic status of folk cultures. This 
helped to shape the highly influential period and historical romances of 
Walter Scott, known as the Waverley novels: Waverley (1814), in its account 
of Charles Edward Stuart's 1745 Scottish rebellion seen through the eyes of 
the young English soldier Edward Waverley, pitted the feudal culture of the 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag

Scottish Highlands against the modernising forces of the eighteenth/century 
English state. 

A similar sense of opposing currents in history is explored in 'The 
Natural History of German Life' when it alludes to the role of the peasantry 
in the German revolution of 1848 (see sections 3.3 and 3.7). The typical 
peasant's obstructiveness and suspicion is noted: 'His chief idea of a govern/ 
ment is of a power that raises his taxes [and] opposes his harmless customs' 
(p. 276). However, modernising governments themselves were hampered by 
as blinkered and self-regarding a vision; 'seen from the windows of ducal 
palaces and ministerial hotels ... it was imagined that [the peasants] had 
a common plan of co'Operation' ? which, given the peasants' view of 
governance, was not the case at all (p. 278). This stress on limited points of 
view leads to the call for the establishment of an authoritative arbiter 
between the restricted points of view held by different social classes, and 
the essay appoints art ? particularly narrative art ? to this powerful role of 
'awakening ... social sympathies' by 'amplifying experience and extending 
our contact with our fellowmen beyond the bounds of our personal lot' 
(p. 264). The essayist contends that 'a wise social policy must be based on 
the Natural History of social bodies', and the novel which observes 'real 
life', rather than stereotypical conventions evident in jovial peasants from the 
idealist, pastoral tradition, has an important educative role to play (p. 285). 

As we move from Marian Evans's critical essay to the novel entitled The 
Mill on the Floss by George Eliot, we need to bear in mind that in 'The 
Natural History of German Life' language is conceptualised through 
its resistance to schematic idealisms, and consequently valued for the 
imaginative complexities it can produce by virtue of its historical 'anomalies 
and inconveniencies'(p. 283). We should not assume that George Eliot's 
theory of realism is based on a naive attachment to mimesis or reflection. 
The Mill on the Floss is a novel steeped in narrative complexities which 
demonstrates a dense engagement with, and reflexivity about, language and 
representation. 

3.13 'Writing the history of unfashionable families': 
the workings of Eliot's 'realism' 

The Mill on the Floss describes itself as a 'history of unfashionable families' 
(p. 385). It does so within a narrative framework which accounts for oppos' 
ing currents of history. First, vestiges of the kind of archaic peasant culture

'Writing the history of unfashionable families' 81 

described in 'The Natural History of German Life' are present in the 
Tulliver family's constitution: family ties and obligations are paramount, 
and Mr Tulliver treats litigation as though it were 'the custom of the 
country' (and his failure to recognise the law as an impersonal system is the 
source of his family's catastrophic fall). Secondly, 'history' figures dimly as 
the distant but developing modern English liberal state of the 1820s, made 
present through allusions to the controversy surrounding its proposal to 
extend forms of social toleration such as Catholic Emancipation. These are 
historical currents which play upon the fears and Protestant prejudices of 
'unfashionable' families. But these families have a perspective which the 
narrator wishes us to hear: 

Uncle Pullett sat by and listened with twinkling eyes to these high matters. He 
didn't understand politics himself ? thought they were a natural gift ? but by 
what he could make out, this Duke of Wellington was no better than he should 
be. (p. 133) 

The dramatisation of limited points of view on historical progress is realised 
through focalisation which privileges 'unfashionable' social types such as 
Uncle Pullett, whose voice we hear through free indirect speech. 

The 'hearing' of voices is important in The Mill on the Floss. The reader 
experiences the mimetic pleasures of direct speech: George Eliot, in com/ 
mon with Scott, Samuel Bamford and Elizabeth Gaskell, uses direct speech 
as an opportunity to incorporate stylised dialects other than standard English 
in order to create a more authentic sense of ordinary life, as in this exchange 
from the beginning of the novel between Mr and Mrs Tulliver, who are 
discussing Tom Tulliver's future education: 

'You mustn't put a spoke i' the wheel about the washin', if we can't get a school 
near enough. That's the fault I find wi' you, Bessy: if you see a stick i' the road, 
you're allays thinkin' you can't step over it. You'd want me not to hire a 
waggoner, 'cause he'd got a mole on his face.' 

'Dear heart!' said Mrs Tulliver in mild surprise, 'when did I iver make 
objections to a man, because he'd got a mole on his face! I'm sure I'm rether fond 
o' the moles, for my brother, as is dead an' gone, had a mole on his brow 

'No, no, Bessy; I didn't mean justly the mole; I meant it to stand for summat 

else; but niver mind It's an uncommon puzzling thing to know what school 

to pick.' 

Mr Tulliver paused a minute or two, and dived with both hands into his 
breeches' pockets as if he hoped to find some suggestion there, (pp. 57?8) 

The reader is invited to acknowledge a hierarchy within this exchange; Mrs 
Tulliver's prosaic and family/centred world view is contrasted with and

82 Bildung and belonging 

subordinate to Mr Tulliver's figurative, outward/ looking, problem/solving 
assault on the world. But at the apex of the hierarchy is the 'omniscient' 
narrative voice, which objectifies both speech and speakers, and knows more 
about the chracters than they can ever know of each other, or indeed 
themselves; Mr Tulliver does not know that the act of digging his hands into 
his pockets betrays his utter loss as to how to proceed with planning Tom's 
education, but the narrator's commentary does. 

Tom's formation is a topic of discussion between others ? he is absent ? 
and the framework for his formation is haphazardly cobbled together by 
family and community: Tom is not present at his own cultivation, and those 
who plan it are mired in narrowness and ignorance. George Eliot's narrative 
voice becomes a highly sophisticated device for tracing the webs within 
which Tom's development is imagined and temporarily stunted. Chapter 3, 
in which Tulliver consults the auctioneer Riley about Tom's education, 
and Riley responds by recommending the services of Stelling, a young 
clergyman to whom he is related, is a good example of the strategies of the 
narrative voice. 

The reader discovers, from Riley's direct speech, that he has a family of 
unmarried daughters to keep, and that he is consequently short of cash 
(p. 69). However, the stark interpretation ? that the self-interested Riley will 
benefit financially from the recommendation of Stelling ? is coloured in 
shades of grey by the narrator. In a long commentary (see pp. 75?7), the 
narrative voice ironically, yet sympathetically, traces the dimly conceived 
rationale behind Riley's advice. Riley, we are told, is acting both self- 
interestedly and without secure foundation for his recommendation; he may 
indirectly be rewarded for the recommendation but knows nothing of 
Stelling 's suitability. And yet, it is more important for the narrator to 
trace how he hides that from himself and others through his sense of self- 
importance and the family and community obligations which shape his 
sense of self. The narrative voice comments reflexively on its 'findings', 
and on its own refusal of melodramatic oppositions between guilt and 
innocence, and evil and good motives: 'Plotting covetousness and deliberate 
contrivance in order to compass a selfish end, are nowhere in abundance 
but in the world of the dramatist' (pp. 74?5). Thus, negative allusions to 
'artificial' dramatic modes help to define the narrative voice's sense of its 
access to the 'realistic' representation of motive and action. 

The narrative voice is at the apex of a hierarchy of character discourses, 
whilst managing their various relations of authority. The reader is invited to 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



'Writing the history of unfashionable families' 83 

be sympathetic to the ignorant and self-important such as Riley, yet this does 
not protect these characters from the narrator's irony. By contrast, as heroine, 
Maggie's discourse is valued more than the discourse of any other character. 
If Tom's education is decided by others, Maggie's formation is dramatised 
for the reader through the detailed representation of her inwardness. In 
the first books of the novel, Maggie's romantic childhood inner world is 
rendered in rich detail. But unlike the effect of a Charlotte Bronte novel, 
inwardness is not permitted to stand as an authoritative viewpoint by itself, 
for it requires some external perspective from which to be judged. After the 
family's fall, Maggie Tulliver's 'enthusiastic' inner spiritual craving for the 
religious writings of a medieval monk, Thomas a Kempis, is presented as 
the best, but still severely limited, inner life that a gifted young woman such 
as Maggie can cultivate in intellectually and socially straitened circum/ 
stances. These circumstances have presented her with 'shreds and patches of 
feeble literature and false history' but no sense, as the narrator teaches, 'of the 
irreversible laws' which form, 'through generations of painful toil', morals, 
religion or 'culture' in its anthropological sense (p. 381). 

In making this judgement clear to the reader the narrative voice confronts 
the topic of irony, which is directed in more or less gentle doses towards 
certain of the characters. This commentary on irony is characteristic of 
George Eliot's realism in that it initiates a discourse which invites the reader 
to grasp a whole web of social relations: 

In writing the history of unfashionable families, one is apt to fall into a tone of 
emphasis which is very far from being the tone of good society, where principles 
and beliefs are not only of an extremely moderate kind, but are always 
presupposed, no subjects being eligible but such as can be touched with a light 
and graceful irony. But then, good society has its claret and its velvet carpets, its 

dinneD-engagements six weeks deep But good society, floated on gossamer 

wings of light irony, is of very expensive production; requiring nothing less than 
a wide and arduous national life condensed in unfragrant, deafening factories, 
cramping itself in mines, sweating at furnaces, grinding, hammering, weaving 
under more or less oppression of carbonic acid ... This wide national life is 
based entirely on emphasis ? the emphasis of want, which urges it into all the 
activities necessary for the maintenance of good society and light irony, (p. 385) 

In this passage, the narrative voice begins in an almost self-admonitory 
manner: unfashionable topics, such as Maggie's poorly cultivated inner life, 
lead one to write, regrettably, in an unfashionable style which offends the 
canon of taste as defined by 'good society' and its preferred tone of 'light 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



84 Bildung and belonging 

irony'. 'Tone' makes the reader aware that 'good society' is based on pre/ 
ferred idioms, thus implicating literature and literacy in what becomes its 
polemic. For there is irony here at light irony's expense, and it arises out of 
the way the narrative voice constructs an opposition between surface 
appearances and understanding in depth. The only depth to be found in 
good society is in the volume of dinner engagements to which it is com/ 
mitted. This in turn is contrasted with depth of understanding, which is 
vested in the narrative voice's knowledge of the increasingly industrialised 
labour of ordinary working life, on the basis of which national life is 
reproduced and resourced. The steps from Maggie's frustrated inner life to 
the harsh material conditions of national life which perpetuate its frustration 
are a good example of Eliot's realism. But that broadening of social 
understanding and sympathy which that realism invites was simultaneously 
an interrogation of received modes of writing and speech. 



3.14 Testing 'self-culture': 'eddication' and the role of the 
reader in Eliot's realism 

Contrasting gendered experiences of formation or bildung produce a 
central irony on which The Mill on the Floss turns. Tom is subjected to a 
masculine 'eddication' in classics and geometry for which he has no 
aptitude, and this actually stifles his formation. He is only liberated, 
ironically, after the family's fall, which requires him to develop practical 
entrepreneurial skills: Tom makes enough money to enable the family to 
purchase the mill again. In contrast Maggie, who is bright, bookish and 
intellectually curious about Latin, is denied access to the very education that 
would enable her to flourish and develop, because of gender. As dutiful 
daughter she is confined to the home after the family's fall, fitfully sustains her 
inner life through the self-renunciating doctrines of Thomas a Kempis, 
becomes a governess but, unlike Jane Eyre, fails to marry the wealthy man 
(heir to a trading fortune). Instead she disgraces herself in the eyes of her 
community by seeming to elope with him. She returns, only to drown along 
with Tom in a dramatic flood as the river Floss bursts its banks. 

Is this a satisfactory story? Some readers have thought not, but then the 
narrative voice draws attention to the language that characters have used for 
shaping Tom and Maggie's lives into stories. Having been committed to the 
inappropriate pedagogic supervision of the Rev. Mr Stelling, Tom flounders 
dismally under the regime of instruction instituted by the Eton Latin 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



Testing 'self-culture' 85 

Grammar. The narration reflects on Tom's difficulties, using Stelling as a 
focaliser: 

Mr Stelling concluded that Tom's brain being peculiarly impervious to 
etymology and demonstrations, was peculiarly in need of being ploughed ... it 
was his favourite metaphor, that the classics and geometry constituted that 
culture of the mind which prepared it for the reception of any subsequent crop. 

Stelling articulates the powerful nineteenth/century theory of the classics 
as the highest source of 'self-culture', and Stelling's choice of a metaphor 
from crop'husbandry clearly illustrates the origins of this 'organic' theory 
of character growth. 35 At this point, the narrator intervenes ironically to 
challenge this metaphor: 

I say nothing against Mr Stelling's theory: if we are to to have one regimen for 
all minds his seems to me as good as any other. I only know it turned out as 
uncomfortably for Tom Tulliver as if he had been plied with cheese in order 
to remedy a gastric weakness which prevented him from digesting it. It is 
astonishing what a different result one gets by changing the metaphor! Once call 
the brain an intellectual stomach, and one's ingenious conception of the classics 
and geometry as ploughs and harrows seems to settle nothing, (pp. 208?9) 

The narrator reflects on the radically different ways in which the formation 
of character can be described. But there is also an acknowledgement of the 
power of language ? not just Latin, but language about Latin, justifying its 
worth ? in forming practices that are commonly held to shape character. 
What is more, the reader is asked to acknowledge a challenge to it. 

'Realist' narration may be complex, striving for a truthful understanding 
of the world; but as George Eliot's use of it illustrates, it has a very clear sense 
of the social conventions that its preferred representations are shaping 
themselves against. The implied reader's habitual recognition of con/ 
ventions for describing educational progress is challenged by a change of 
metaphor, and this suggests something important about the dynamic and 
educative reading relations in which Eliot's narrative imagined itself to 
participate. The problem that this addressed was theorised by the journalist 
and man of letters George Henry Lewes ? George Eliot's partner ? in his 
scientific theories of sensation and mental association. In The Physiology of 
Common Life, which was written while George Eliot was working on her 
own narrative representation of common life in The Mill on the Floss, Lewes 
confronts the problem of forms of speech which have become habitual and 
non/reflective: 'We utter, as meaningless expletives, phrases which originally 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



86 Bildung and belonging 

cost us trouble to learn.' 36 There has been a tendency for some strands of 
recent criticism to argue that Eliot's realism effectively pacifies its readers, 
didactically shoring up received ideas. 37 In historical context, viewed in 
relation to Victorian theories of mental activity and reception, it can be 
argued that Eliot's narratives sought to enter into dynamic, educative but 
interrogative relations with readers and their reserves of cultural knowledge. 
Significant novel writing is invariably innovatory in the ways in which 
it can absorb, whilst testing, the boundaries of genres and received forms 
of discourse. In Eliot's innovative fiction writing, 'art' was conceived as a 
vehicle which would mediate a higher social lesson. In the next chapter we 
will move towards an account of a different kind of innovatory energy in the 
practice of fiction: one in which the shaping and integrative power of 'art' 
is proclaimed as an end in itself. However, our critical practice will need to 
remain aware of the social contexts within which such proclamations were 
made.

Innovative stories and distinctive readers 



4.1 The art of prose narrative 

In 1842, the American writer and critic Edgar Allan Poe explained why 
he conceived of the short 'prose tale' as a distinctive form of art: 'The tale 
proper, in our opinion, affords unquestionably the fairest field for the 
exercise of the loftiest talent which can be afforded by the wide domains of 
mere prose." On the one hand there are the 'wide domains of mere prose': 
as we saw in section 1.2, prose ? straightforward discourse ? is defiantly 
ordinary. On the other hand there is the tale, a condensed narrative which 
asks to be handled by the 'loftiest talent', or authors who can exploit its 
artistic potential. This has been achieved when the sensitive reader experi/ 
ences a 'unity of effect or impression' which is more usually encountered 
during the reading of the densely stylised and patterned discourse of poetry. 
Thus, the best kind of prose tale can achieve a unified, poetic effect, whilst 
it can treat a much wider variety of subject matters than poetry (prose still 
traverses a 'tableland of far vaster extent'). 

Poe's statement accounts for the aesthetic energy of certain kinds of prose 
narrative, and the effects of this energy on the reader. As such it offers a 
gateway to this chapter, which will explore ways of reading artistically self- 
conscious trends in novel writing and fictional prose narrative ? including 
the prose tale or short story ? in the nineteenth century and early decades 
of the twentieth century. It will explore how and why such narratives were 
shaped into distinctive and innovative forms of art. 

But first we have to negotiate a question: have not the narratives that we 
have explored so far transformed the 'straightforward discourse' of prose into 
artefacts of distinctiveness? Of course, novels and narratives from given 
periods settle upon conventions which can easily become formulaic; but as

Charles Dickens's Bleak House 91 

the last two chapters have demonstrated, from the period of its English 
origins the novel has always had the potential to embrace innovatory energies, 
borrowing from other genres of prose narrative and non/narrative discourse, 
and in the process demonstrating a capacity to generate 'new' forms of 
expression, as the name 'novel' suggests. But in the last decades of the 
nineteenth century and early decades of the twentieth century, select novelists 
self-consciously rejected their inherited traditions of realism and became 
radically experimental. Accordingly the period has been viewed as 'tran/ 
sitional', and the artistic phenomenon which the transition heralded has 
come to be known as 'Modernism'. 

'Modernism' as a literary/historical category was constructed in the 1950s 
in an attempt to create a homogeneous artistic and intellectual movement 
out of tremendous historical diversity. 2 Noting this, I shall use the term 
'experimental' to describe narratives by writers such as Katherine Mansfield 
and Virginia Woolf, writers who are generally referred to as 'Modernists'. In 
steering a path through this diversity, the discussion will distinguish between 
the various sources of innovation and distinctiveness in narrative art. These 
sources will include the emergence of poetically inflected prose styles; in/ 
creasingly self-conscious critical reflections on the form and scope of story/ 
telling, in particular the emergence of the short story and its relation to the 
novel; narratives which foreground the voice and subjectivity of characters 
whilst rejecting the authoritative impositions of a realist narrator; and the 
emergence of a culturally distinctive implied reader who is, above all, a close 
reader. The texts we will focus on are Charles Dickens's Bleak House; Henry 
James's The Spoils of Poynton; H. G. Wells's Ann Veronica; Thomas Hardy's 
story 'The Withered Arm', and Katherine Mansfield's story 'The Garden 
Party'; and Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway, as well as a selection of critical 
texts by James, Wells and Woolf. The discussion will be framed by a context 
which we have been tracing since Chapter 2: social and cultural modern/ 
isation and the development of new popular reading experiences which 
intensified the struggle to produce 'distinctiveness'. 

4.2 Charles Dickens's Bleak House: reading the estranging 
poetry of prose 

From one point of view, Charles Dickens is a Victorian novelist. Because 
Dickens addressed the social transformations of the early and mid/ Victorian 
periods through his powerful and widely read fictions, he was seen as a figure 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



92 Innovative stories and distinctive readers 

who entertained an homogeneous middle/class readership whilst pricking 
their collective social conscience.' From a later point of view Dickens was 
seen as a transitional figure: in the 1920s the novelist and intellectual Percy 
Wyndham/Lewis claimed that Dickens's earliest novel (Pickwick Papers, 
1837) displayed a level of stylistic and narrative innovation that anticipated 
Modernism. 1 Bleak House (1852?3) is a challenging novel to read because 
of its narrative and stylistic complexity. How are we to read, but also con/ 
textualise, such complexity? 

Dickens constructs a labyrinthine mystery story; Bleak House is the first 
English novel to boast, in Mr Bucket, a police detective character. The 
multi'plot story gradually reveals a web of connections between a maze/like 
law case in Chancery (Jarndyce and Jarndyce), illegitimacy, and a multi' 
tude of characters inhabiting a wide range of places and social roles, from 
country estate/dwelling aristocrats (Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock) to 
urban social outcasts (Jo, the crossing/sweeper). In its attempt imaginatively 
to grasp a whole society the novel employs a complex narrative framework, 
comprising two discrete methods of narration. First, there is the illegitimate 
Esther Summerson's first'person past'tense narration. Secondly, there is an 
omnipresent (able to move freely between characters and situations) third/ 
person narrative voice, which creates a contrasting effect of immediacy by 
telling the story in a tense known as the historic/present (in which the verbs 
are all present tense, though the actions to which they refer are past, in 
common with all narrated acts). 

With this latter method of narration, Dickens is able to generate some 
arresting and indeed estranging effects. Here, the omnipresent narrative 
voice focalises through Jo the crossing/sweeper, and the topic of the passage 
is 'strangeness': 

It must be a strange state to be like Jo! To shuffle through the streets, unfamiliar 
with the shapes and in utter darkness as to the meaning, of those mysterious 
symbols, so abundant over the shops, and the corner of streets, and on the doors, 
and in the windows! To see people read, and to see people write, and to see the 
postman deliver letters, and not to have the least idea of all that language ? to be, 
to every scrap of it, stone blind and dumb! It must be very puzzling to see the 
good company going to the churches on Sundays, with their books in their 
hands and to think (for perhaps Jo does think, at odd times) what does it all 
mean, and if it means anything to anybody, how comes it that it means nothing 
to me! To be hustled, and jostled, and moved on; and really to feel that it would 
be perfectly true that I have no business here, or there, or anywhere; and yet to be 
perplexed by the consideration that I am here somehow, too, and everybody 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



Charles Dickens's Bleak House 93 

overlooked me until I became the creature that I am! It must be a strange state, 
not merely to be told that I am scarcely human (as in the case of my offering 
myself for a witness), but to feel it of my own knowledge all my life! To see the 
horses, dogs, and cattle, go by me, and to know that in ignorance I belong to 
them, and not to the superior beings in my shape, whose delicacy I offend! Jo's 
idea of a Criminal Trial, or a Bishop, or a Government, or that inestimable 
jewel to him (if only he knew it) the Constitution, should be strange! His whole 
material and immaterial life is wonderfully strange; his death, the strangest thing 
of all. 5 

The first point to note is the historic present tense of the passage, which is 
most visible in the contrast between the infinitive form of the verbs which 
describe Jo's life in the present (to shuffle, to see, to think, to feel), and the fact 
that the narrator knows of Jo's death. Otherwise, the strangeness consists in 
the effects that are rendered in seeking to represent a mind or consciousness 
from which the conventional structuring devices of socialised consciousness 
- social and familial relationships, literacy and the memories that 
relationships, reading and writing help to shape ? are absent, as in Jo's case. 
We should note an important transition from the third person to the first 
person, which is marked by the sudden intrusion of Jo's distinctive, 
colloquial idiom upon the narrator's voice: 'how comes it that it means 
nothing to me?' What is estranging about this transition is that Jo's idiom 
then recedes, and Jo's place in a world without knowledge and meaning ? 
closer to the perspective of beasts than humans ? is described in a gram/ 
matically correct and idiomatically conventional public voice, predicated by 
a subjectivity, the T, which society withholds from Jo ('to be told that I am 
scarcely human'). 

It may be argued that Dickens, in contrast to Scott, Bamford, Gaskell 
and Eliot, who project character voices through non/standard dialects (see 
sections 3.9, 3.13), here reneges on the challenge to represent Jo's voice, 
subjecting an outcast character to the norms of a middle'class public voice. 
But elsewhere in the novel (and throughout his works) Dickens excels at 
styling characters through forms of direct speech which are distinctive, 
idiomatic, and symptomatic of their lives, as in the case of the minor but 
much/buffeted Phil Squod: '"let 'em throw me. They won't hurt me. I have 
been throwed, all sorts of styles, all my life!" ' (p. 423). So Dickens's strategy 
in the passage above is calculated to make the reader work in a particular 
fashion. The key to that fashion is well described by Bakhtin, who has 
explained it with reference to 'language/images', or parodic representations 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



94 Innovative stories and distinctive readers 

of authoritative forms of language use. 6 The institutions of the law, the 
church, and governance are parodied, and summed up in the narrator's 
ironic reference to the English Constitution as an 'inestimable jewel'. The 
status and condition of Jo mean, of course, that it is anything but. 

Consequently, we can develop a more productive interpretation: in 
reading about a figure who cannot read, for whom shop signs are mysterious 
symbols, readers are invited to reflect on their understanding of the mysteri/ 
ous symbols at work in the novel, which in turn may cast an estranging light 
on the familiar signs and objects that comprise the fabric of social and 
material life. This is confirmed in the very first paragraph of Bleak House, 
which opens with an urban street'scene where the street is hard to recognise: 

London. Michaelmas term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor sitting in 
Lincoln's Inn Hall. Implacable November weather. As much mud in the 
streets, as if the waters had but newly retired from the face of the earth, and it 
would not be wonderful to meet a Megalosaurus, forty feet long or so, waddling 
like an elephantine lizard up Holborn Hill. Smoke lowering down from the 
chimney pots, making a soft black drizzle with flakes of soot in it as big as fulk 
grown snowflakes ? gone into mourning, one might imagine, for the death of the 
sun. Dogs, indistinguishable in mire. Horses, scarcely better; splashed to their 
very blinkers. Foot passengers, jostling one another's umbrellas, in a general 
infection of ill temper, and losing their foothold at street corners, where tens of 
thousands of other foot passengers have been sliding and slipping since the day 
broke (if this day ever broke), adding new deposits to the crust upon crust of 
mud, sticking at those points tenaciously to the pavement, and accumulating at 
compound interest, (p. 49) 

In one sense, this opening declares a commitment to realism: the coordinates 
of space (London, the Inns of Court, Holborn Hill) and time (November 
and, for the law, the professional time of terms) seem to promise precision 
and clarity. Yet the defining feature of the time/space configuration that 
Dickens actually constructs is captured in the adjective used to describe dogs 
in the mud: 'undistinguishable'. Though precision is half promised by 
one level of signification, readers find themselves in an impressionistic blur 
where linearity is frustrated, an effect in part created by single words followed 
by stops: 'London.'; or sentences without verbs: 'Implacable November 
weather.'. The images rendered with greatest clarity ? the waters receding 
from the face of the earth, and the dinosaur waddling up Holborn Hill ? are 
the most fantastic and, in the context of a London street, unlikely. 

We should also note the workings of metaphor in generating the mean/ 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



Charles Dickens's Bleak House 95 

ings attached to grim, prosaic features of the city. Metaphor is present when 
meaning is created by the substitution of one sign or 'thing' for another sign 
or 'thing' which is similar to it. Accordingly the descending smoke which 
contributes to the effect of darkness and the blurring of boundaries is 
represented in a complex way. The properties of soot ? its shape and colour 
? are signified by not merely one, but two substitutions. First, its moving 
shape is substituted for something which is 'like' it, yet also its opposite; the 
white snowflake. Secondly, having been compared to something white, the 
actual blackness of soot is visualised through funereal clothing which is 
mourning the death of the sun, and, by implication enlightenment. Simi/ 
larly, the mud piling up at street corners is seen metaphorically in that it is 
substituted for an image drawn from the discourse of finance: it is, like 
invested money, 'accumulating at compound interest'. The forcing of a 
connection between muck and money is, in terms of the wider architecture 
of Dickens's novel, instructive: the purpose of the complex story is to en/ 
lighten the reader, revealing the connections between privilege and poverty. 

How are we to explain these stylistic features? In the preface to Bleak House 
Dickens stated that his aim was to reveal the 'romantic side of familiar things' 
(p. 43). This is another version of the realisnvand'romance opposition 
which we traced through Chapter 2. But Dickens is using the opposition to 
conceptualise the act of looking at a familiar object in an effort to see it in a 
different, or, to borrow a specialised critical term coined by Victor Shklovsky, 
'defamiliarising', fashion.' As our analysis of the opening passage of Bleak 
House suggests, Dickens 'defamiliarises' through a convention/breaking 
approach to grammar and syntax, but also metaphor. Metaphoric substitu/ 
tion, as the linguist Roman Jakobson has argued, is the dominant linguistic 
characteristic of poetry. As part of the same argument he claimed that prose 
tends to be characterised by the workings of metonymy, a related figure of 
speech which creates meaning by associating one sign with another on the 
basis of familiar contiguities of time and space (November is contiguous in 
time to the end of Michaelmas term, Holborn Hill is contiguous in space to 
Lincoln's Inn Hall). 8 The prose of the novel is made distinctive by stylistic 
features which generate innovative, poetic effects: the language of prose 
attains a symbolic density. 

These effects cannot be divorced from the space that Dickens is represent/ 
ing: the city of London. Bleak House is not exclusively an urban fiction, for 
Dickens's novel asks the reader to grasp imaginatively the social networks 
which bind city and country together. But it was the urban environment 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



96 Innovative stories and distinctive readers 

which intensified many of the most disturbing, yet, given that a growing 
majority of the population were urban dwellers, familiar experiences of mid 
nineteenth/century modernisation: poor living conditions, over/population, 
traffic, anonymity and crime. It is significant that Dickens defamiliarises the 
urban scene, rendering familiar things through unfamiliar symbols, thus 
setting before his readers an estranged way of seeing which, as we have seen, 
is also dramatised in Jo the outcast crossing/sweeper. We need to bear in 
mind that Dickens's novel aims to capture the reader's conscience, as in the 
rhetorical address by the omnipresent narrator at Jo's death: 'Dead, your 
majesty. Dead, my lords and gentlemen . . . And dying thus around us every 
day' (p. 705). Consequently, estranging stylistic effects in Bleak House are 
localised and subordinated to this moral purpose. 

To this end they jostle with recognisable popular techniques of represen/ 
tation, such as melodrama, which dramatises domestic secrecy and its revel/ 
ation through gesture and posture, as in the moment when the glance of the 
closed and distant Lady Dedlock, secret mother to the illegitimate Esther, 
meets the glance of Lawyer Tulkinghorn, who knows her secret: 'for an 
instant the blind that is always down flies up. Suspicion, eager and sharp, 
looks out. Another instant; close again' (p. 527). Clearly, Dickens uses 
both innovative techniques which challenged the reader into establishing 
meanings, based on metaphors and language images; and established and 
conventional forms of meaning construction, such as rhetorical addresses 
and melodramatic stagings between characters. The limits of Dickens's 
willingness to 'defamiliarise' that which was familiar and comforting to the 
domestic sensibilities of his readers is perhaps marked by the closure of his 
novel: the married Esther is installed with her doctor husband in a visually 
quaint and conventional 'cottage, quite a rustic cottage' (p. 912). 

4.3 'Reading' in context: journalism and fiction 

To understand the transitions that shaped experimental trends in the novel 
and prose narrative in the later nineteenth century, it is helpful to place 
Dickens's stylistic medley and its mid Victorian readership in context. 
When the first edition of Bleak House appeared in volume form, Dickens 
boasted that: 'I believe I have never had so many readers as in this book. May 
we meet again!' (p. 43). How could Dickens claim a readership for a book 
that was only just published? The readers to whom Dickens refers read the 
book in serialised format. Whilst readers of today purchase Bleak House as a

'Reading' in context 97 

unified object, the novel was initially published in nineteen individually 
issued parts, between March 1852 and September 1853. Dickens did not 
submit a completed novel manuscript to a publisher; as the most recent 
number was appearing on the streets, Dickens was busy writing the 
following instalment. 

This is just one of the features of the diverse publishing practices of mid 
Victorian literary culture which secured large readerships through quasi/ 
journalistic techniques. The connections between novel writing and 
journalism in the nineteenth century were extensive. We have seen how 
Marian Evans was a journalist before she became 'George Eliot' the novelist 
(see section 3.12). Dickens also trained as a journalist: he worked first as a 
Parliamentary reporter, and when an established novelist he also edited the 
weekly magazines Household Words and All the Year Round. We saw in section 
3.4 how Victorian periodicals played an important role in reviewing novels 
and forming canons of taste. Increasingly, periodicals gave over space to the 
publication of serialised fiction: Household Words and All the Year Round 
carried serial versions of certain of Dickens's novels: A Tale of Two Cities 
appeared in All theYear Round in 1859. Moreover, journals became sites 
where fictional and non/fictional narratives exchanged and reworked rep/ 
resentations of social life: in a piece of investigative journalism for Household 
Words Dickens followed a police detective through the streets of London, 
and this was used as the basis of some of the writing for Bleak House? 
'Sensation fiction' was a popular and important genre in the 1860s, antici/ 
pated by Bleak House. This genre traded on stories of divorce, bigamy and 
domestic violence, which were being made public as a result of legal reforms 
and the new styles of reportage which were established to render them into 
narrative. 10 Wilkie Collins's The Woman in White (1859-60) and Mary 
Elizabeth Braddon's Lady Audley's Secret (1861?2) were melodramatic novels 
of suspense and secrecy which commanded large readerships. Indeed, 
through these networks Victorian readers could consume the variety of the 
world, delivered to them through novelistic and journalistic prose narrative 
forms which often overlapped. 

In practice, Dickens's stylistically complex yet enormously varied narra/ 
tives successfully exploited the new apparatuses of publication and circu/ 
lation. These developments helped to shape a new and reactive aesthetic 
self-consciousness in the theory and practice of the late nineteenth/century 
novel.

4.4 Nuggets for the masses: newspaper stories 

Mid nineteenth/century journalistic energy presaged a newspaper revolution 
in Britain in the later nineteenth century. In the 1880s and 1890s mass circu/ 
lation newspapers such as Alfred Harmsworth's Daily Mail were founded. 
The popular 'New Journalism' of these decades advertised itself as provide 
ing immediate access to the 'real'. As T. P. O'Connor stated in the first 
editorial of the Star, a London evening paper founded in 1880: 

In our reporting columns we shall do away with the hackneyed style of obsolete 
journalism; and the men and women who figure in the pulpit or the law courts 
shall be presented as they are ? living, breathing, in blushes or in tears ? and not 
merely by the dead words they utter." 

In its commitment to the dramatisation of people and events, newspaper 
techniques in the 1880s and 1890s became, as John Stokes has remarked, 
'analagous to those of fiction', because 'the "story" became the basic molecu/ 
lar element of journalistic reality; a structured nugget of information ? the 
basic unit through which the reader was to be presented with events.' 12 

Let us take a closer look at an example of the narrative structure of a 
characteristic 'nugget of information', a story taken from the Illustrated London 
News from 4 February 1899. The topic of the story ? a disputed claim to the 
legitimate inheritance of a title and a country house ? carries resonance in 
relation to the novel we will examine next, Henry James's roughly contem/ 
poraneous The Spoils of Poynton (1897). The Illustrated London News was, by 
this date, an established weekly newspaper, having been founded in 1842 
with a national and international mandate ('a complete record of all the 
events of the week, at home, abroad or in the colonies') addressed to the 
'RESPECTABLE FAMILIES OF ENGLAND'. 1 ' Ground/breaking 
at its inception, the Illustrated London News continued to innovate by being 
one of the first newspapers to move from engraved illustrations to black/and' 
white photographs to illustrate its stories. 

For example, a story about the rivalry between Viscount Hinton and his 
half-brother W. J. L. Poulett is illustrated by a portrait of Poulett, and 
two commanding perspectival views of the disputed Hinton House and 
grounds (see Figure 1), which construct for the viewer an authoritative gaze 
on the 'real' objects around which the drama of the story turns: 

The rival claimants to the Poulett peerage have done with 'interviews', and their 
case must be left for settlement to the lawyers. The elder claimant, Viscount 
Hinton, who has made his living lately as an organ/grinder, and whose claims

have elicited considerable popular sympathy, was the son of his father's first wife, 
and was born six months after the wedding ceremony. The younger claimant, 
the Hon. W. J. L. Poulett, a son by his father's third wife, was born in 1883, and 
had the late Earl's recognition as his rightful heir. The dispute turns on a 
question of legitimacy, as to which neither lawyers nor doctors in England 
appear able to agree. Meanwhile, Viscount Hinton has become an object of 
much curiosity in the vicinity of Henry's Buildings, Clerkenwell, where the 
organ-grinder is already proudly spoken of by his fellowtenants as 'the noble 
Earl'. The tenants on the family estates at Hinton St. George, near Crewkerne, 
await events as placidly as does the rest of the public. Hinton House, in Somer/ 
setshire, dates from the time of Henry VII. The garden front was designed by 
Inigo Jones. The park extends to about six hundred acres. (Illustrated London 
News, 4 February 1899, p. 161) 

How does this work as a 'story'? As in a narrative discourse that we may find 
in a novel, we can transform the surface ordering of events into a chronology, 
beginning with the Tudor origins of the contested estates and house, 
succeeded by the birth of Viscount Hinton ('the organ/grinder') six months 
after his parents' marriage, followed by the later birth of the younger, and 
recognised, half-brother the Hon. W. J. L. Poulett. Even though 'factual', 
the topic of the story turns on devices which were central to the construction 
of many fictional narratives in the second half of the nineteenth century. 
Illegitimacy was used as a plot device in both Bleak House (Esther is the 
illegitimate daughter of Lady Dedlock) and The Woman in White. In 
addition, the prospect of the elevation of the 'organ/grinder' to privilege, 
which appeals to 'popular sympathy', echoes narratives of class trans/ 
position concerned with the discovery of true origins and the restoration of 
lost rights. This is a staple novel plot: it is present in Jane Eyre (Jane's 
inheritance of her uncle's fortune) and extends at least as far back as the 
1740s in Fielding's Josep h Andrews. 

This particular newspaper story is governed by a register which seeks to 
minimise the dramatic and sensational: 'popular sympathy' is subordinate to 
the arbitration of professional authority (doctors and lawyers) and tenants 
on the Hinton estates are awaiting the outcome 'placidly'; the 'public' is 
invoked to suggest that this is the general, but also appropriate, response. 
Different newspapers construct different versions of the 'public' in accord/ 
ance with their preferred code of behaviour and values. Even so, the power 
of the 'New Journalism' is evident intertextually at the opening of the story, 
when it is reported that 'The rival claimants to the Poulett peerage have done 
with "interviews" ', or the advancement of their respective claims through

disclosures about themselves. The interview was a prose genre developed 
and popularised by the 'New Journalism'. Based on a recorded encounter 
between a journalist and a famous or controversial subject, it was one of the 
techniques used for eliciting and representing, in line with T. P. O'Connor's 
aim, the 'living, breathing' truth about the subjectivity under scrutiny. The 
rhetoric of such truth/ divining techniques often depended on conventions 
of characterisation which were analogous to those found in the frameworks 
organising realist novels. An interview with Mark Twain, for example, 
recorded that the rich ornamentation found in his house was 'no mere 
extraneous accumulations such as any man of wealth might create, but a 
gradual and organic outgrowth of the owner's mind which gives you a 
delightful peep into the inner recesses of his character'. 11 

Clearly, such 'nuggets of information' were stories with complex struc 
tures and intertertextual resonances. It is important to remember, though, 
that in its mandate to record the life of the nation and its empire, a newspaper 
comprised a collection of such nuggets. For instance, the story about the 
Poulett legitimacy contest is situated between stories about the price of rail 
travel for the working class in London, and the annual dinner of the Play/ 
goers' Club. Other matters of interest in the early months of 1899 reported 
by the Illustrated London News included the launch in Belfast of the then 
largest ship in the world (the White Star liner Oceanic). In addition, there 
were numerous stories from the geographically dispersed colonies comprise 
ing the empire. This led to grand claims couched in imposing metaphors: 
as one late nineteenth/century editor put it: 'A newspaper, like society, is 
an organism which has a soul as well as a body. Its sustenance is drawn from 
the four quarters of the globe. Its nerves run in delicate fibres over two 
hemispheres.' 15 

These claims were not universally accepted. The American writer Ralph 
Waldo Emerson commented on the power of the popular newspaper, 'which 
does its best to make every square acre of land and sea give an account of 
itself at your breakfast table'; a power at once expansive and, as Emerson 
implies, too easily consumed and consequently reductive." This dissatis' 
faction with the newspaper and the consumerist culture of modernising 
societies which it embodied was shared by Henry James, an American 
writer who settled in England in the 1870s. James is, as we established in 
Chapter 2, a central figure in the history of novel criticism in English. In the 
later years of the nineteenth century James forged an aesthetically innovative 
approach to the novel, which challenged reductive and indiscriminate

02 



102 Innovative stories and distinctive readers 

approaches to reading through the production of narratives marked by 
stylistic complexity. To explore this we will look at The Spoils of Poynton and 
James's theory of the novel. 



4.5 Reading the 'sacred nugget': distinctive narrative art in 
James's The Spoils of Poynton and its 'Preface' 

The Spoils of Poynton is a story about a young woman, Fleda Vetch, who 
is required to act as an intermediary between two disputants: the widowed 
Mrs Gereth and her son, the engaged and soon to be married Owen. It is, 
consequently, a novel about class and taste distinctions. The mother, who 
embodies English aristocratic values and tastes, despises the son's fiancee, 
Mona Brigstock, who will displace the older woman from Poynton, the 
Gereth family's Jacobean country house: this is anathema to Mrs Gareth 
because the Brigstock family represent 'new wealth' and new, more populist, 
tastes. Mother and son are consequently in dispute over possession of the 
historic artistic treasures housed in Poynton ('the spoils of Poynton'). 

The Spoils of Poynton was first published serially in a periodical (the 
Atlantic Monthly, 1896), where it was entitled The Old Things. However, 
its transformation into The Spoils of Poynton is symptomatic of James's am/ 
bition to convert the novel into a self-conscious and distinctive art form. He 
achieved this in part by furnishing the later 'New York' editions of his 
novels with prefaces in which the critical prose is as stylised and symbolically 
resonant as the prose of the novels. Moreover, critical prose and novel narra/ 
tive taken together situate James's critical project in a field of cultural debate, 
as we shall see in sections 4.6 and 4.7. 

In the 1908 preface to The Spoils of Poynton, James self-consciously reflects 
on the means by which he encountered and artistically transformed the raw 
material of the story, selecting it from a snippet of society gossip overheard 
at dinner, 'a mere floating particle in the stream of talk' (the story was based 
on an actual incident from life), and turning it into a 'tiny nugget, washed 
free of accretions and hammered into a sacred hardness'. James constructs a 
key binary opposition between 'Life' which is characterised negatively by 
'inclusion and confusion', and 'art' which is, in positive contrast, 'all dis' 
crimination and selection' (p. xxxix). 17 According to this opposition, the 
confusion and inclusiveness of 'Life' may be found in a novel by Dickens, 
or a Victorian popular newspaper, to their detriment (James described 
English Victorian novels as 'loose, baggy monsters'). 18 James's story, on the

other hand, is seen metaphorically as a 'hardened' golden nugget of sacred 
artistry. 

By linking 'art' with hardness James is here challenging received ideas 
about material objects and the means by which they are conventionally 
represented. The Spoils of Poynton is, of course, about splendid objects and a 
contest for their possession. James acknowledges the 'heroic importance' of 
these objects, and recognises the way in which they might have been reprc 
sented by writers renowned for their skills of visual realisation, such as the 
influential mid nineteenth/century French realist novelist Honore de Balzac. 
However, the objects are not, as readers of the novel have discovered, care/ 
fully delineated (p. xliii). James refuses the verisimilitude of visual descrip/ 
tion that we can find in Dickens (Esther's charming rustic cottage), and 
which the Illustrated London News generated by photography. James explains 
how he came instead to realise the objects at the centre of the novel impress 
sionistically: their collective effect is conveyed to the reader almost spectrally 
as 'the shimmer of wrought substances [which] spent itself in the bright/ 
ness' (p. 38). James is concerned with a unity of narrative effect which gives 
his story nugget a 'sacred hardness': to achieve such unity objects have 
consistently to be seen through a 'weight of intelligent consciousness'. In this 
instance, the consciousness is that of the artistic Fleda Vetch, who is, to use 
our term, the narrative's focaliser (pp. xlvii? xlviii). The preface to The Spoils 
of Poynton highlights the value of Fleda's 'intelligent' inward 'appreciation' 
of exterior things and objects. Such an 'intelligent' mode of appreciation is, 
James contends, actually fundamental to the processes of active discrimi/ 
nation and selection that distinguish 'art' from the chaos of 'Life'. How 
does this work in the scheme of the novel? 

4.6 James's narration and the discriminating reader 

James undoubtedly took the novel in new directions, but in some respects, 
The Spoils of Poynton is a novel which continues to work with the familiar 
machinery of Jane Austen's early nineteenth/century novel of manners. Like 
Emma (see section 2.5), James's novel is based on restricted vision, scheming, 
mild deception, misunderstanding, self-delusion and the dramatic irony that 
such a combination of elements produces. 

It is helpful to sketch these elements. Mrs Gereth identifies the materially 
impoverished but aesthetically sensitive Fleda as a person of taste and artistic 
sense, who appreciates the 'spoils' that she is to lose to her son and his fiancee, 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag

104 Innovative stories and distinctive readers 

Mona. Fleda stands by Mrs Gereth's 'cause' in the dispute, interceding on 
her behalf in an attempt to persuade Owen to forgo his legal right to the 
treasures. Mrs Gereth has illegally appropriated the treasures from Poynton 
and taken them to the cottage to which she has been banished. In taking 
Mrs Gereth's side, Fleda finds herself becoming attracted to Owen, whose 
relationship to Mona is foundering because of the dispute; in an about turn, 
Fleda responds to Owen and vows to help him to get the treasures back. But 
Fleda also senses that Owen is becoming attracted to her. She thus finds 
herself on the horns of an ethical dilemma: in acting to save Owen's re 
lationship with Mona, Fleda finds herself pursuing a goal which is contrary 
to her own interests, in that an opportunity for her to become mistress of 
Poynton seems to arise. James's story is thus a finely tuned 'little drama', as 
he says in the preface, about the ethics of possession, influence and action. 

What makes the story distinctive is the dense narration which employs 
conventions that we are now familiar with, whilst technically refining them 
to produce a unity of effect which demands attentive reading. The narrative 
technique is broadly analogous to Austen's in Emma: it is third/person which 
regulates the reader's distance from the dramatised focaliser: although we 
consistently 'see' through the perceptions of Fleda's 'subtle mind' (p. 8), 
what she perceives is articulated by an impersonal narrative voice which 
offers additional comment to and sometimes upon Fleda herself. But beyond 
this, James strives for complexity in the way in which he exploits the limits 
of his focaliser's knowledge by creating interpretative challenges for the 
reader. 

Thus, at the point at which Owen appeals to Fleda for her help in per/ 
suading his mother to return the 'spoils', the reader is confronted with an 
apparent revelation: 

he stood there with his hand on the knob and smiled at her strangely. Clearer 
than he could have spoken it was the sense of those seconds of silence. 

'When I got into this I didn't know you, and now that I know you how can 
I tell you the difference; And she's so different, so ugly and vulgar, in the light of 
this squabble. No, like you I've never known one. It's another thing, it's a new 
thing altogether. Listen to me a little: can't something be done;' It was what had 
been in the air in those moments at Kensington, and it only wanted the words to 
be a committed act. The more reason, to the girl's excited mind, why it shouldn't 
have words; her one thought was not to hear, to keep the act uncommitted, 
(pp. 67-8) 

Owen appears to articulate his growing attraction to Fleda and his 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



05 



James and the discriminating reader 105 

alienation from Mona's vulgarity. But this is a complex passage. Despite the 
inverted commas which appear to mark Owen's direct speech, this speech is 
framed by the narrator's account of, first, 'seconds of silence' which create a 
'sense' which is 'clearer' than speech; and, second, 'the girl's excited mind'. 
It is not clear on first reading, but on rereading this passage the reader is 
invited to infer that the moment is silent and enigmatic, but that Owen's 
speech is being 'imagined' in Fleda's head: it is worth pointing out here that 
elsewhere in the narrative, we see Fleda imagining herself as though in a 
scene from a novel (p. 37). But the passage uses this moment of difficulty 
as a foundation for the construction of additional interpretative questions. 
The narrator reports that Fleda sees a connection between speech and action, 
which suggests that if a thought is committed to words, then an act has 
thereby been committed. Conversely, if there are no words, then there is no 
committed act, and Fleda with her moral scruples ? she does not want to act 
on Owen's behalf having been cast in the role of a rival to Mona ? hopes 
that the 'sense' of the moment will not be committed to words 'to keep the 
act uncommitted'. And yet, the 'sense' has been committed to words in what 
we could describe as the narrator's representation of Fleda's inner speech. 
Even though 'imagined' it has become an act, and it does influence Fleda's 
capacity for action and judgement. 

This passage dramatises the complexity of Fleda's subtle, subjective 
dilemmas. As for Owen's thoughts, the unity of effect maintained by Fleda's 
position as focaliser means that they remain an enigma: at the very moment 
at which Owen is about to inform Fleda of the identity of 'the one person 
on earth I love' he is interrupted, and the reader does not find out who this 
is (p. 115): but he marries Mona and installs her at Poynton. 

Mrs Gereth returns the 'spoils' to Poynton believing, mistakenly, that 
Owen has married Fleda. In a final dramatic twist, the 'spoils', and Poynton, 
are consumed in a fire. But Fleda has already learned that the true value of 
the spoils does not reside in their materiality but instead in their impress 
sionistic, ghost'like haunting of memory, a so'called 'fourth dimension' 
(p. 172). We can see then that the values of inward aesthetic appreciation 
and judgement espoused in James's preface are dramatically upheld in the 
resolution of the story. The reader who appreciates this lesson is the dis' 
criminating and sophisticated one that the dense and challenging narration 
implies. 

This reader is also implied in 'realistic' details which actually have the 
force of resonant symbols, or details which signify beyond the surface

106 Innovative stories and distinctive readers 

comedy of manners which seems to contain them. James's opposition 
between 'art' as discrimination, and 'Life' as inclusion and confusion, is at 
work in 'realistic' details which are integral to the evaluative schema of the 
novel and its wider cultural resonances. Houses symbolise values, modes of 
perception and taste in The Spoils of Poynton. Poynton is aristocratic and old, 
and is represented through a discourse of discriminating aestheticism: when 
Mrs Gereth and Fleda perceive it, the treasures and the fabric of the house 
together create an impression of wholeness and harmony. On the other hand, 
Waterbath, the home of the wealthy and sporty Brigstocks, is associated 
with modernisation: it is symbolised by 'the acres of varnish, something 
advertised and smelly, with which everything was smeared' (p. 4). It is 
notable that the varnish of Waterbath symbolises all'inclusiveness ? there 
are acres of it covering everything ? and self-advertisement. To move from 
the novel to wider currents in 1890s culture and society for a moment, we 
find James using this symbolic scheme to read the 'gross defacement of 
London' during preparations for the popular celebration of Queen 
Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897: he abhorred 'the miles of unsightly 
scaffolding between the West End and the City, the screaming advertise/ 
ments'. 19 James's novel may affirm an aesthetic mode of reading and 
appreciation at the level of form and content, but this involves rejection as 
well as affirmation. The Brigstocks are explictly associated with newspaper 
and magazine culture: on their first visit to Poynton, Mona and her mother 
bring a new women's magazine ? 'quite new, the first number' (p. 18) ? as 
a gift, which Mrs Gereth comically but symbolically flings back at the party 
when they are leaving. A certain kind of easy and accessible culture is 
rejected here. 

At this moment of transition in the history of the novel, readers' skills and 
alignments were being assigned to sharply differentiated cultural domains, 
the high/prestigious and the lowpopular, a point which is articulated 
clearly in the novelist Joseph Conrad's reaction to The Spoils of Poynton. He 
praised its 'delicacy and tenuity', but when he thought of the 'man in the 
street' trying to read it he recoiled with the kind of nameless horror that he 
was later to reserve for Mister Kurtz in Heart of Darkness (1899), his own 
dense and challenging imperial narrative about the mind's encounter with 
the impenetrable: 

I imagine with pain the man in the street trying to read it! And my common 
humanity revolts at the evoked image of his suffering. One could almost see 
the globular lobes of his brain painfully revolving and crushing, mangling the

delicate thing. As to his exasperation it is a thing impossible to imagine and too 
horrid to contemplate. 20 

The innovative novel is a delicate organism being crushed by a machine 
(the man in the street is one of the masses). As we shall see, images and 
metaphors map the terrain of this new division. 

4.7 Contesting 'The Future of the Novel': Henry James's 
'delicate organism' and H. G. Wells's 'right to roam' 

James wrote a number of essays on the novel. In this section I shall focus on 
two, 'The Art of Fiction' (1884) and 'The Future of the Novel' (1899). 
Later H. G. Wells wrote on 'The Contemporary Novel' (1911). Between 
these positions we can, at this moment of transition, trace a debate about the 
future and scope of fictional prose narrative. This was a debate conducted 
through images of machines, organisms, floods and roaming explorers, 
which addressed a wider question: how should narrative be written and read 
in the context of the currents of change and modernisation which charac 
terised late nineteenth/century societies? This question beats a path to formal 
experimentation with both the novel and the short story. 

James's position was to invoke self-conscious narrative art as a mode of 
thoughtful, individualised (or at least minority/led) responsiveness to wide/ 
ranging social changes. James's concern with 'The Art of Fiction' in the 
1884 essay is in part a response to the novelist Walter Besant, who had 
written an essay of the same title. Besant advocated a journalistic view of 
the function of the novel, arguing that it should aim to entertain a wide 
readership; be realist in the sense that it should absorb contemporary social 
questions into its story; and be reformist in its aim to generate sympathy in 
resolving them. In many respects this was a populist late nineteenth/century 
extension of George Eliot's 'aesthetic of sympathy' (see section 3.12). For 
Besant, 'sympathy is that sentiment which is destined to be a most mighty 
engine in deepening and widening the civilisation of the world.' As John 
Goode observes, this makes the novel 'a sparking/plug, an engine to ignite 
an engine'. 21 

In his account of the art of fiction in 1884, James implicitly refutes the 
engine metaphor, emphasising instead the primacy of organic form: A 
novel is a living thing, all one and continuous, like any other organism, and 
in proportion as it lives will it be found, I think, that in each of the parts 
there is something of each of the other parts.' 22 James's view of the formally 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



108 Innovative stories and distinctive readers 

integrated literary novel as a 'sensitive organism' is in stark contrast to his 
sense of 'the failure of distinction, the failure of style, the failure of know/ 
ledge, the failure of thought' which characterises the bulk of popular stories 
and novels. 2 ' In 'The Future of the Novel', James envisions this bulk as a 
deluge: 'The flood at present swells and swells, threatening the whole field of 
letters, as would often seem, with submersion.' Establishing this context 
helps us to see James's theory of the novel as a reaction to the commercial 
networks which dominated literary culture. His protest was directed at the 
modern fiction 'industry', which 'put into circulation more volumes of 
"stories" than all other things' aimed at 'schoolboys' and women. 24 James 
was reacting to an upsurge of interest during the 1880s and 1890s in 
adventure stories and romances (following the great popular successes of 
H. Rider Haggard's African imperial adventure King Solomon's Mines, 1885, 
and Robert Louis Stevenson's pirate romance Treasure Island, 1883). 2S For 
James these popular trends signified that 'we are ... in the presence of 
millions for whom taste is but an obscure, confused, immediate instinct.' 
Observing that a 'community addicted to reflection and fond of ideas will 
try experiments with the "story" ' which would secure a future of continuous 
innovation for the novel, James feared for its future in England. 26 

What was H. G. Wells's opinion? There is a tendency to view their 
respective positions in this debate about the future of the novel in the light of 
Wells's declaration that 'I had rather be called a journalist than an artist.' 27 
This makes James sound like the artist, and Wells the hack champion of 
those mind'numbing acres of ephemeral newsprint. In some respects, how/ 
ever, Wells and James articulate quite similar views of the novel. Both held 
that novels needed to challenge readers by breaking with conventions and 
forms which flooded the fiction market. In 'The Contemporary Novel' 
Wells attacked dominant tastes by satirising a middle'class male/gendered 
reader named 'the Weary Giant', who ? appropriately for a giant ? is un/ 
thinkingly addicted to popular escapist romances after a hard day at the 
office. 28 Moreover, both Wells and James were of the view that, potentially, 
the subject matter of the novel was limitless given that, in a changing society, 
manners were themselves evolving. 29 

The main point of contention between James and Wells was their differ/ 
ent attitudes to narrative form and method. James's insistence on 'organic' 
formal coherence, unified around 'centres of consciousness', was not shared 
by Wells. For Wells the novel is: 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



09 



Reading H. G. Wells's Ann Veronica 109 

a discursive thing; it is not a single interest, but a woven tapestry of interests; one 
is drawn on first by this affection and curiosity, and then by that; it is something 
to return to, and I do not see that we can possibly set any limit to its extent. The 
distinctive value of the novel among written works of art is in characterisation, 
and the charm of a well/conceived character lies, not in knowing its destiny, but 
in watching its proceedings. 

There are two elements to Wells's claims for the 'distinctiveness' of a novel. 
First, there is the representation of character development. Second, there is 
the claim that the process of character development is best realised in recog' 
nising that the novel is 'a discursive thing', or 'a woven tapestry of interests'. 
In many respects, Wells's theory of the novel resonates strikingly with 
present/day critical interests in the relation between cultural discourse and its 
woven, textual manifestation in the novel (see sections 1.7?8). Wells's theory 
is well captured in his defence of the novel's 'right to roam' through a multi' 
plicity of contemporary discourses and 'interests' that will comprise testing 
grounds for its characters. 30 

4.8 Reading H. G. Wells's Ann Veronica 

Wells practised 'the right to roam' in his controversial novel Ann Veronica 
(1909). This third/person narrative traces Ann Veronica Stanley's social 
and sexual awakening from her frustrated and restricted life in her father's 
house in a new suburb of London, to her affair with and marriage to Mr 
Capes, a writer and scientist. Ann Veronica's development is a result of the 
novel's 'roam' through a constellation of conflicting late Victorian dis' 
courses and interests which represent a society in transition. Consequently, 
Ann Veronica's progress is woven from her battles with repressive Victorian 
patriarchy in the person of her narrow-minded, middle'class father; her 
education in domestic rebellion and Fabian socialism derived from the 
Widgett family; her rejection of idealistic late Romantic bohemianism in the 
person of Mr Manning; her seduction by and rejection of male sexual 
hypocrisy in the person of Mr Ramage; her attraction to and rejection of late 
Victorian feminist discourses and the political struggle for female suffrage in 
Miss Miniver; and her embrace of the authoritative discourses of biological 
science, social Darwinism and sexual selection (or 'romance') in the person 
of Mr Capes. Wells's narrator leaves the reader in no doubt about the social 
authority of biology in the context of discursiveness: 

The biological laboratory had an atmosphere that was all its own. It was at the 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag

110 Innovative stories and distinctive readers 

top of the building, and looked clear over a cluster of inferior buildings ... The 
supreme effect for Ann Veronica was its surpassing relevance; it made every 
other atmosphere she knew seem discursive and confused. 

Whereas James pared his stories down to aesthetically unified 'nuggets', 
Wells revelled in the discursiveness of his stories. It would be inconceivable 
for the reader of The Spoils of Poynton to encounter Fleda Vetch's conscious/ 
ness ruminating on the 'reconstruction of the methods of business, of econ/ 
omic development, of the rules of property, of the status of children, of the 
clothing and feeding and teaching of everyone': but, prior to the character's 
recognition of the authority of biological science, Wells's roaming narrator 
makes Ann Veronica worry about precisely these things, in these very 
precise terms, even though Ann Veronica allegedly experiences them as 'a 
clamorous confusion of ideas for reconstruction'. 31 

Wells's argument in 'The Contemporary Novel', and his practice in 
novels such as Ann Veronica, were motivated by a conviction that the novel 
was abrogating its social mission. In many respects, Wells was restating the 
argument for 'the aesthetic of sympathy'. In pinpointing a cause for this loss 
of direction and purpose, Wells singled out a trend in the theory of fiction. 
He argued ? with James in his sights ? that attempts to define the novel 
around questions of narrative method and technical refinement were mis/ 
placed. Such efforts were most appropriately addressed to another fictional 
prose narrative form, the short story, which, by definition, was unified rather 
than discursive. 32 Wells's argument points to the emergence of 'the short 
story' in this period of literary transition, and the way in which certain 
trends in short story and novel writing started to develop in technical unison. 
We will explore these issues in the concluding sections of this chapter. We 
shall also see that Wells's affirmation of the 'discursive' novel came to be 
contested by these very trends. I noted above the way in which Ann 
Veronica's immersion in the 'clamorous confusion of ideas' for social reform 
is actually represented very neatly by the narrator, the topics of debate being 
packaged into delineated topics of discussion. When the experimental 
novelist Virginia Woolf looked back critically on 'Edwardian novelists' 
such as Wells from the perspective of the 1920s, she argued that their novels 
suffered from an excess of detail and discursiveness. Moreover ? and this 
was especially damaging to Wells and other Edwardians such as Arnold 
Bennett, who defined the novel around the practice of character construction 
- Woolf argued that discursiveness and detail drowned out the voices of 
their characters. As we shall see, the representation of voice in fictional prose

11 



The short story 111 

narrative is a crucial issue, and developments in the short story helped to 
make it so. 



4.9 The short story 

In the preface to The Spoils of Poynton Henry James reflected on a moment of 
indeterminacy during the imaginative gestation of his story: 'The thing had 
"come", the flower of conception had bloomed ... yet ... my idea wouldn't 
overstrain a natural brevity. A story that couldn't possibly be long would 
inevitably be "short".' So James's sense was that when he first started to write 
his story for magazine publication (as The Old Things), he was writing a 
short story. However, as he wrote the instalments, his story appeared to need 
greater expansiveness until he came to regard it as 'the poor little "long" 
thing' (xliv). The Spoils of Poynton is marked by an economy and condensed 
brevity that distinguishes it from many of its novelistic predecessors and 
contemporaries. James's self-conscious anecdote points to questions relating 
to the relationship between the short story and the novel. Of course, James 
sees this problem from the perspective of the writer in the process of com/ 
position. However, the problem was a significant one for critics and readers 
as well: critics in the period came to reflect upon 'the short story' as a 
distinctive genre in its own right. 

In practice, short fictional narratives were a long/established part of the 
nineteenth/century publishing landscape. In the earlier part of the century 
writers generally referred to these narratives as 'tales', a term which has 
its origins in a root word which signified oral discourse in a number of 
Northern and Central European languages (see OED). As we saw at the 
beginning of this chapter, it was in 1842 that the American novelist, poet 
and critic Edgar Allan Poe first reflected upon the prose tale, arguing that it 
is characterised by two properties: first, it can be read at one sitting, and 
second, the reader experiences a unity of effect (see section 4.1). This theory 
was, in effect, recycled in 1884 when the American critic Brander Matthews 
coined the term 'short/story' (idiosyncratically hyphenated) for a British 
audience: his account of the genre, which stressed the principle of 'unity of 
effect', was derived from the earlier ideas of Poe. 33 It is notable that Matthews 
was theorising the aesthetic effects of the short story in the same year as 
Henry James published 'The Art of Fiction', when the novel itself was 
being theorised as an organic unity through aesthetic criteria. 

It could be said that this period witnessed a transition from the 'tale' to the

aesthetically sophisticated short story. Terms for explaining this transition 
have been suggested by the critic Eileen Baldeshwiler, who, in sketching 
a history of the genre, distinguishes between epical and lyrical varieties 
of story. The epical foregrounds dramatic incident and story: the 'what' of 
narrative. The lyrical ? a generic term conventionally associated with poetic 
form ? foregrounds states of mind at particular moments: the 'how' of 
narration (see section 2.4)." We can explore the appropriateness of these 
terms in relation to two contrasting short stories by Thomas Hardy and 
Katherine Mansfield. Analyses of these stories will show this to be a useful 
distinction, though, ultimately, it does not do justice to demands which the 
complex handling of voice places on the reader. More recent critics such as 
Clare Hanson and Dominic Head have come to regard short fiction from 
this period as a genre which played an important role in reeducating 
readers' attention to narration itself." But this new focus of attention was 
recognised by Robert Louis Stevenson in 1884 when, in response to Henry 
James, he claimed that literature 'so far as it imitates at all ..., imitates not 
life but speech; not the facts of human destiny, but the emphasis and the 
suppressions with which the human actor tells of them'." 

4.10 Thomas Hardy's 'The Withered Arm': the epical tale 

Thomas Hardy completed his story 'The Withered Arm' in 1887; it was 
published in 1888, first in Blackwood's Magazine, and then in Hardy's own 
collection of Wessex Tales (1888). 37 The use of 'tales' in Hardy's title is 
significant, for 'The Withered Arm' can be categorised as an epical fiction 
in so far as plot and incident are central to the unity of effect. 

Rhoda Brook, a milkmaid, lives with her illegitimate son. Neither is 
acknowledged by the man who has caused Rhoda to 'fall', Farmer Lodge, 
who marries a beautiful young woman, Gertrude. Rhoda sends her son to 
look at his father's new wife, and on the basis of the report that she receives 
constructs a vivid mental image of the woman. One night she experiences a 
visitation from an 'incubus' or phantom which attempts to squeeze the life 
out of her: the incubus is seen by Rhoda as an aged and degenerate image of 
Gertrude. Rhoda resists by grasping the arm of the invader and flinging 
its whole body to the floor. A sense of horror is the unifying effect which 
compels further reading. 

The next day Rhoda is visited by the actual Gertrude, who has come 
to the cottage to offer charity to Rhoda's son, whose impoverished state

Gertrude has observed. In response to inquiries as to her well/being, 
Gertrude discloses that she has a problem with her arm, which is mysteri/ 
ously becoming painful and withered, with the outline of fingermarks upon 
it. As Gertrude physically degenerates and is unable to conceive a child, her 
relationship with Farmer Lodge deteriorates in proportion to the worsening 
condition of her arm. In desperate need of a solution which conventional 
medicine cannot provide, she visits a 'conjuror', who magically reveals to her 
the obscure image of the person who wishes her harm; whereupon Rhoda 
and her son exile themselves from the community. Six years elapse, 
Gertrude's arm continues to worsen, and she pays another visit to the 
'conjuror', who advises her that the only remedy is the 'turning' of her 
blood, and this can only be effected by her touching the warm corpse of a 
man killed by hanging. Gertrude discovers that a hanging is to take place at 
nearby Casterbridge: the condemned is a young man. During the public 
execution she gains access to the prison with the help of the hangman and is 
in the process of touching the corpse when a shriek breaks out behind her: 
it is Rhoda and Farmer Lodge, who have come to collect the body of the 
executed young man, who turns out to be their illegitimate son. Rhoda flings 
Gertrude against the wall by her arm; her blood 'turns', but too much, and 
she dies within three days. 

Horror and the macabre are clearly unifying effects, but it is within an 
'epical' structure of events that the more subtle unifying dramatic ironies of 
recognition (anagnorisis) and reversal (peripeteia) are generated. Gertrude 
recognises that her husband is the former lover of Rhoda and father to her 
child, and that she has displaced Rhoda and is the target of Rhoda's bitter/ 
ness. The source of the recognition ? the identity of the corpse ? is also the 
source of the narrative reversal: for that which Gertrude believed would 
restore her turns out to be the cause of her destruction. 

The events which generate this concluding moment are rooted in 
discourses of, first, the supernatural, exemplified by the incubus; and, 
second, superstition, exemplified in the figure of the 'conjuror', and the 
rumours in the community that Rhoda, as a 'fallen' woman, has witclvlike 
powers. The supernatural and superstition link the rural world of the story 
to the archaic associations attached to the 'tale' as a genre. Representations of 
rumour and gossip privilege oral methods of communication: the narrator 
states that there was only one newspaper serving the community, and that 
word'of-mouth communication was the most effective means. 38 One would 
not want to take this too far ? after all, Hardy's is a highly literate and written

text ? but there is a sense in which the narrator's style draws upon gestures 
associated with traditional, oral methods of story/telling. Walter J. Ong has 
pointed to ways in which narrators from oral traditions rely on patterns, 
repetitions and props to keep a narrative memorised and on track, and we 
can perhaps discern an element of this in the way in which Rhoda's son has 
to make two visits to form an impression of Gertrude, and Gertrude has to 
make two visits to the 'conjuror', which is reminiscent of the structures of 
repetition often found in folk tales. 3 ' As this suggests, and despite snatches 
of direct/speech dialogue which we associate with character construction, 
characters in 'The Withered Arm' are more like functions of the plot than 
psychologically complex subjects: the son is never much more than a 
function, an agent who is the cause of the two meetings of the two women 
characters (as impoverished boy and as corpse). 

4.11 Katherine Mansfield's 'The Garden Party': 
the lyrical story 

If we turn now to Katherine Mansfield, we find a very striking contrast. 
'The Garden Party' was published in 1922. Like 'The Withered Arm', 
'The Garden Party' concludes with its central character, Laura Sheridan, in 
the presence of a corpse. As we see from her reaction, death and sleep are 
seen from what may be described as a poetic standpoint: 

There lay a young man, fast asleep ? sleeping so soundly, so deeply, that he was 
far, far away from them both. Oh, so remote, so peaceful. He was dreaming. 
Never wake him up again. His head was sunk in the pillow, his eyes were closed; 
they were blind under the eyelids. He was given up to his dream. What did 
garden parties and baskets and lace frocks matter to him. He was far from all 
those things. He was wonderful, beautiful. While they were laughing and while 
the band was playing, this marvel had come to the lane. Happy . . . happy. . . . 
All is well, said that sleeping face. This is just as it should be. I am content. 40 

The events that lead to this conclusion all take place on the same day: they 
involve the Sheridans, a middle/class family, preparing and hosting their 
annual garden party. The accidental death of a local working/class man 
occurs on the same day. When Laura Sheridan, adolescent daughter, learns 
of this she calls for the party to be abandoned, but her family overrule her. 
After the party and on the suggestion of her mother, Laura pays a charitable 
visit to the dead man's family. There is, then, no intricate plotting, and we 
can see that all of the main elements of the story are present in Laura's 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



15 



Katherine Mansfield's 'The Garden Party' 115 

concluding moment of insight: the garden party and its superficial pleasures, 
the dead man in whose presence her realisation takes shape, the charitable 
basket that Laura takes as a token of sympathy. 

It is the lyrical prose in which these elements are embedded which is 
significant. We have already observed the extent to which death and sleep 
figure poetically as interchangeable states. There are other poetic figures 
which indirectly signify death, such as the man's closed eyes being blind 
beneath his eyelids. We should also note further features which render 
this moment lyrical: the sound effects created by assonance are striking 
(sleep/deep). The 'what' of a fairly basic plot is emphasised in the 'how' of 
narration. 

Such lyrical effects are combined with short and elliptical sentences ('Oh, 
so remote, so peaceful. He was dreaming.') which signify the rapid move/ 
ment of mind and consciousness. For as Clare Hanson has argued, the 
lyrical short story was derived from two sources: the prose poem and the 
psychological sketch, which were prevalent in magazine publication in the 
1880s and 1890s. The prose poem shaped the kind of poetic language which 
organises the symbolic prose of 'The Garden Party'. The psychological 
sketch influenced the lyrical short story, of which 'The Garden Party' is an 
example, towards representations of consciousness. As Hanson points out, 
the psychological sketch was especially favoured by late nineteenth/century 
'New Woman' writers such as George Egerton. 11 

We appear to have, then, two kinds of short story. In Hardy's epical 'The 
Withered Arm', recognition and reversal are foregrounded by the story. 
Recognition occurs in 'The Garden Party' as well (Laura recognises the 
superficiality of the garden party when confronted with death), but it is 
significantly different from Hardy's story in that the reader of 'The Garden 
Party' follows Laura's recognition through access to her inwardness, regis/ 
tered through her inner speech. 

But inwardness poses interpretative problems for the reader because 
Mansfield's narrator is minimally present. For example, the object of recog' 
nition in Mansfield's short story is actually quite difficult to state with 
certainty. This is exemplified in the closing lines of 'The Garden Party': on 
her return from the house of the dead man, the crying Laura meets her 
brother Laurie: 

'Isn't life' she stammered, 'isn't life ? ' But what life was she couldn't explain. No 
matter, he quite understood. 

'Isn't it, darling;' said Laurie, (p. 261) 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



116 Innovative stories and distinctive readers 

We should note here that we have moved from Laura as focaliser, registered 
through her inner voice, to Laurie as focaliser, who 'understands' her un/ 
finished enunciation about 'life'. Practically, however, such understanding 
would be difficult to conclude, because Laura's utterance is of indeter/ 
minate status, neither a statement nor a question and missing an adjective. 
Laurie, then, speaks for Laura to 'fill in' the gap: '"Isn't it, darling?"' This 
is a process that the narrative explores: we should remember that at the 
moment when Laura gazes at the corpse she also 'speaks' for it in her 
imagination: 'All is well, said that sleeping face. This is just as it should be. 
I am content.' The difficulty here is: how can Laura know? 

Being able to read the story at one sitting enables the reader to locate 
parallel technical effects and interpretative questions in a focused manner. 
The question 'how can Laura know?' is one that the critical reader may 
transport to this moment after rereading the very first paragraph of 'The 
Garden Party', where Laura is the focaliser and the image of the garden is 
recounted in her 'voice': As for the roses, you could not help feeling that they 
understood that roses are the only flowers that impress people at garden 
parties' (p. 245). Laura's sense of what the roses understood of themselves 
is as fanciful and as subjective as her conviction that she could be friends 
with the workmen who arrive to erect the marquee. The episode which ends 
with Laura's imagined sense of her ability to maintain easygoing, cross/ 
class relations begins with the narrator reporting that Laura attempts to be 
authoritative with the workmen by unconvincingly 'copying her mother's 
voice' (pp. 246-7). 

This is an important detail. For in Katherine Mansfield's handling of the 
lyrical or technically experimental short story, one could argue that voice and 
speech are actually 'objects' of recognition, presented to the reader dramatic 
cally by the narration. The extent to which Laura's 'voice' is permeated by 
her mother's discourse and its evaluations is something that becomes appar/ 
ent to the reader. As the reader progresses with the story, it becomes clear that 
Laura's mother, Mrs Sheridan, is an authoritarian figure who is concerned 
with beautiful things but also with the pragmatic maintenance of her family's 
privileged position to afford them. When the idealistic and artistic Laura 
insists that the garden party be cancelled out of respect for the dead working 
man, Mrs Sheridan replies 'coldly' that '"People like that don't expect 
sacrifices from us." ' Mrs Sheridan speaks for the maintenance of class differ/ 
ences and contractual obligation over social sympathy. But in contrast to 
conventional devices for constructing character, Mrs Sheridan's direct

The experimental novel 117 

speech and its values not only defines herself: they permeate Laura's voice 
as well. The opening lines of the story are both focalised by Laura and 
rendered in her voice: And after all the weather was ideal. They could 
not have had a more perfect day for a garden party if they had ordered it' 
(p. 245). As Dominic Head points out, the language of idealism and that 
of pecuniary command are juxtaposed in these lines. 42 Mrs Sheridan's 
language conditions the mapping of social space in Laura's consciousness: 
when Laura thinks of the cottages where the dead man has resided she 
recalls that 'children swarmed. When the Sheridans were little they were 
forbidden to set foot there because of the revolting language and what they 
might catch' (p. 254). The point of the implied author's intense focus on 
Laura's voice and its unstable mix of artistic idealism and pragmatism 
would seem to be that it is language as well as disease that one catches: 
Laura, despite her best intentions, has caught her mother's. 

It is clear that Katherine Mansfield's 'The Garden Party' is a lyrically rich 
narrative which places subjectivity and voice in the foreground. But this is 
to dramatise and interrogate social relations and interactions: indeed, it is 
precisely about the way in which these are registered in voices and images of 
speech. In acknowledging this, we are reminded of Stevenson's point about 
questions of emphasis and suppression in narration. Thus, even epical short 
stories raise questions about voice and subjectivity. If we look at Hardy's 
'The Withered Arm' again, it is important to note that Rhoda's struggle 
with the incubus is of undecidable status given that the reader only sees it 
from Rhoda's highly subjective perspective. The abrupt shift to a subjective 
focus in an otherwise 'epical' and exteriorised act of story/telling suggests 
that the implied author poses a question: is it a visitation or a psychological 
projection arising from social and emotional exclusion? Accordingly, the 
source of the tragic action ? supernatural or social? ? remains open and 
ambiguous. 

4.12 The experimental novel: reading for voice and 

consciousness in Virginia Woolf 's Mrs Dalloway 

The short story offers a particularly intensive reading experience. The narra/ 
tives of Katherine Mansfield exemplify the kind of experimentation with 
voice which leads us to a consideration of the distinctive presence of voice 
in the experimental novel. We will explore these by first looking closely at 
the opening of Virginia Woolf's post/ World War I Mrs Dalloway (1925), a 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



118 Innovative stories and distinctive readers 

narrative about a middle/aged, middle/class wife of a Member of Parlia/ 
ment on the day she holds a society party. At the same time, we need to recall 
H. G. Wells's anxiety about the collapsing distinction between the novel 
and the short story (see section 4.8). Indeed, the unified focus and fore/ 
grounding of voice in both experimental short story and novel invite a 
question: what distinguishes the experimental novel from the experimental 
short story? We will explore this question before going on to set Virginia 
Woolf's novelistic experimentation in cultural context. 
Let us begin by looking at the opening of Mrs Dalloway: 

Mrs Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself. 

For Lucy had her work cut out for her. The doors would be taken off their 
hinges; Rumpelmeyer's men were coming. And then, thought Clarissa 
Dalloway, what a morning ? fresh as if issued to children on a beach. 

What a lark! What a plunge! For so it had always seemed to her when, with 
a little squeak of the hinges, which she could hear now, she had burst open the 
French windows and plunged at Bourton into the open air. How fresh, how 
calm, stiller than this of course, the air was in the early morning; like the flap of 
a wave; the kiss of a wave; chill and sharp and yet (for a girl of eighteen as she 
then was) solemn, feeling as she did, standing there at the open window, that 
something awful was about to happen; looking at the flowers, at the trees with 
the smoke winding off them and the rooks rising, falling; standing and looking 
until Peter Walsh said, 'Musing among the vegetables;' ? was that it; ? 'I prefer 
men to cauliflowers' ? was that it; He must have said it at breakfast one morning 
when she had gone out onto the terrace ? Peter Walsh. He would be back from 
India one of these days, June or July, she forgot which, for his letters were awfully 
dull; it was his sayings one remembered; his eyes, his pocket-knife, his smile, his 
grumpiness and, when millions of things had utterly vanished ? how strange it 
was! ? a few sayings like this about cabbages. 

She stiffened a little on the kerb, waiting for Durtnall's van to pass. A charms 
ing woman, Scrope Purvis thought her (knowing her as one does know people 
who live next door to one in Westminster); a touch of the bird about her, of the 
jay, blue/green, light, vivacious, though she was over fifty, and grown very white 
since her illness. There she perched, never seeing him, waiting to cross, very 
upright. 

For having lived in Westminster ? how many years now; over twenty, ? one 
feels in the midst of the traffic, or waking at night, Clarissa was positive, a 
particular hush or solemnity; an indescribable pause; a suspense (but that might 
be her heart, affected, they said, by influenza) before Big Ben strikes. There! Out 
it boomed. First a warning, musical; then the hour, irrevocable. The leaden 
circles dissolved in the air. Such fools we are, she thought, crossing Victoria 
Street. For Heaven only knows why one loves it so, how one sees it so, making it

up, building it round one, tumbling it, creating it every moment afresh; but the 
veriest frumps, the most dejected of miseries sitting on doorsteps (drink their 
downfall) do the same; can't be dealt with, she felt positive, by Acts of Parlia/ 
ment for that very reason: they love life. In people's eyes, in the swing, tramp and 
trudge; in the bellow and the uproar; the carriages, motor cars, omnibuses, vans, 
sandwich men shuffling and swinging; brass bands; barrel organs; in the 
triumph and the jingle and the strange high singing of some aeroplane overhead 
was what she loved; life; London; this moment of June. 

In common with 'The Garden Party', Mrs Dalloway opens in medias res with 
an air of expectation, preparations for a social gathering: flowers have to be 
purchased, workmen are due to arrive. Another similarity is that the reader 
is promptly introduced to Clarissa Dalloway 's voice, registered in the idiom/ 
atically distinctive 'For Lucy had her work cut out for her.' Otherwise, 
readers may experience some problems of orientation when beginning to 
follow Clarissa Dalloway 's movements on 'this moment of June', finding 
the seemingly random detail difficult to place in order. 

A term often used to explain the workings of early twentieth/century ex/ 
perimental narration is 'stream of consciousness', a concept which was first 
coined in the late nineteenth/century subjectivist and pragmatist psychology 
of William James, and which was appropriated by novel criticism. 'Stream 
of consciousness' writing strives to represent the myriad and subjective 
random impressions, sensations, memories and thoughts that comprise the 
activity of mind in the course of its daily activities. Woolf claimed that the 
experimental novel should aim to capture such movements in her essay of 
1919 entitled 'Modern Fiction'. 'Stream of consciousness' deliberately 
eschews the consistent use of those stabilising conventions which order prose 
narrative, making experience ? even the experience of inner life and thought 
? into a coherent story like this: 

Mrs Dalloway could see that Lucy had her work cut out so she told her servant 
that she would go out and buy the flowers herself. Stepping out, she began to 
remember her adolescence at Bourton, and the amusing sayings of her old friend 
Peter Walsh; when would he return from India, was it June or July; As she 
paused to let a van pass before crossing the road her neighbour Scrope Purvis 
caught sight of her, admiring her poise, but noting her paleness: Clarissa's attack 
of influenza had affected her. But Clarissa was oblivious to his gaze, hearing 
instead Big Ben as it boomed out, marking the passing of another hour. 

The opening of Mrs Dalloway does not read like this: but neither is it, strictly 
speaking, 'stream of consciousness'. The best examples of that can be found

120 Innovative stories and distinctive readers 

in other experimental writings from the period, such as Dorothy Richard/ 
son's multi'volumed novel Pilgrimage (1915?35) and the final chapter 
('Penelope') of James Joyce's Ulysses (1922), in which the voices of Miriam 
Henderson and Molly Bloom are represented through unpunctuated, 
elliptical and ungrammatical verbal forms which really do create challenges 
for our senscmaking abilities. What my rewriting of the opening of Mrs 
Dalloway demonstrates is the clarifying effect produced by a maximally 
present third/person narrator. 

Yet such a narrator is minimally present in Woolf's original, and even 
evident in the very first sentence: 'Mrs Dalloway said she would buy the 
flowers herself The difficulties of reading are generated by what this 
narrator delays in explictly announcing. Thus, whilst we are told that 'She 
stiffened a little on the kerb, waiting for Durtnall's van to pass', it is not 
immediately clear until the next sentence that we have switched to Clarissa's 
neighbour as a focaliser, for though it is the narrator who mediates Scrope 
Purvis's perception, his voice (A charming woman') is encountered before 
its source is identified. 

The minimalist narrator is thus overshadowed by other voices. Scrope 
Purvis's voice constructs Clarissa metaphorically as a bird: she is likened to 
a jay, and she notably 'perches' on the kerb. Poetic awareness is thus seen 
to reside in everyday impressions. The principal voice belongs to Clarissa, 
whose impressions are represented in the form of an interior monologue. 
Impressions impinge on Clarissa's senses. We have encountered an earlier 
version of this in Dickens's opening to Bleak House: we might say that this 
is the poetic prose of modern urban life. This prose is characterised by an 
alliterative catalogue of impressions of the crowd and activity ('tramp and 
trudge', 'shuffling and swinging'). Clarissa's impressions also establish two 
conflicting senses of time: the first is the linear time measured and regulated 
by Big Ben ('the hour, irrevocable': Woolf's working title for Mrs Dalloway 
was 'The Hours'); the second is 'the moment' which resists the regulatory 
discipline of linear time by grasping the complex simultaneity of 'the 
moment' as it is experienced subjectively. 



4.13 The novelistic scope of Mrs Dalloway 

The foregrounding of voice, the lyricism and complexity of the moment, 
and the fact that the action of Mrs Dalloway unfolds during a single day 
bring Woolf's narrative close to the unifying effects of the experimental short

21 



The novelistic scope of Mrs Dalloway 121 

story. In this section, we shall explore how, nonetheless, it achieves the scope 
of a novel. In doing this, we should first note that Woolf 's idea began its life 
as a short story entitled 'Mrs Dalloway in Bond Street' (published in 1923). 
In order to draw some contrasts with the opening of Mrs Dalloway extracted 
in section 4.12, let us look at the way in which Woolf opened her earlier 
short story: 

Mrs Dalloway said she would buy the gloves herself. Big Ben was striking as she 
stepped out into the street. It was eleven o'clock and the unused hour was fresh 
as if issued to children on a beach. But there was something solemn in the 
deliberate sway of the repeated strokes; something stirring in the murmur of 
wheels and the shufle of footsteps . . . 

A charming woman, poised, eager, strangely white/haired for her pink 
cheeks, so Scrope Purvis, C.B., saw her as he hurried to his office. She stiffened 
a little, waiting for Durtnall's van to pass. 

Obviously Woolf revised the opening of the final version of Mrs Dalloway. 
In the short story Mrs Dalloway is going to buy gloves rather than flowers. 
Scrope Purvis is clearly established as a focaliser, and Mrs Dalloway 's stiff- 
ening to allow the van to pass is, coming after his establishment as focaliser, 
unambiguously what he sees; and he sees Mrs Dalloway prosaically as a 
woman rather than poetically as bird/like. 

Most significantly, the narrator uses Big Ben immediately to establish the 
time. The time prompts Mrs Dalloway 's thought that the 'unused hour was 
as fresh as if issued to children on a beach', an image which is reused in the 
opening of Woolf 's later version. In the short story the image is followed by 
a sense of the solemnity that the strokes of Big Ben register, which creates a 
tension with the carefree image of childish pleasures. In Mrs Dalloway, by 
contrast, we get an inward turn: Clarissa's sense of the morning being 'as 
fresh as if issued to children on a beach' is followed by 'What a lark! What 
a plunge!' The carefree image of the children on the beach takes Clarissa 
back to her youth. The narration of Mrs Dalloway explores the way in which 
impressions of the moment prompt associations which lead back to memory: 
Clarissa's reflection on the fact that Rumpelmeyer's men are coming to take 
the doors off their hinges recalls to her consciousness the squeak of the 
hinges of the French doors at Bourton when she was eighteen, which in 
turn recalls Peter Walsh, a companion and lover from her youth, which in 
turn loops back to the present and the news of his return from colonial 
India. 

Memory is dramatised to evoke a complex sense of the connections

122 Innovative stories and distinctive readers 

between the past and present in characters' lives, and this is one of the main 
ways in which Mrs Dalloway achieves a breadth and scope which are novel/ 
istic. Through fragments of Clarissa's memory and recollection the reader 
is returned impressionistically to the social and intellectual world of late 
Victorian middle/class England, and Clarissa's initial exposure to Peter 
Walsh's radical ideas and her subsequent conformist marriage to the corner/ 
vative Richard Dalloway. Later in the narrative, when Peter Walsh visits 
Clarissa, he becomes a focaliser and voice in his own right. The reader 
encounters his own memories and bitter disappointment in Clarissa, but 
also his colonising attitude to women, which is dramatised through his 
'piratical' pursuit of an anonymous woman in central London. 

We should not underestimate the challenge involved in constructing 
significance through memories, parallels and dramatised detail. Readers of 
the opening pages of Mrs Dalloway have to keep asking: 'What is relevant 
here, whom will the story prioritise, whom do I need to invest in?' The initial 
process of reading the narrative is made difficult by the minimalist narrator, 
who eschews the hierarchies of discourse which were such a staple of the 
Victorian realist novel as practised by Eliot (see section 3.13). To begin with 
Peter Walsh is merely a name, one of Clarissa's memories: but he becomes 
central. Scrope Purvis is endowed with a voice and his own way of seeing, 
but then is never mentioned again and makes no contribution to the story. 
Septimus Warren Smith, the shell/shocked victim of trench warfare, 
becomes a major voice in the novel, dramatising recent history: namely the 
war, assumptions about 'appropriate' masculine responses to it, and the 
medical treatment of trauma. To begin with, however, he is a character 
whom the reader first encounters briefly during the opening sequence of the 
narrative, when the narrator, in tracing the slow progress of a grand motor 
car through the busy streets, orchestrates the distinctive focalisations and 
voices of a variety of individuals in response to it: Septimus's paranoid 
sense that he alone is blocking the car's progress is initially on a par with the 
response of the workman who thinks he has seen '"the Proime Minister's 
kyar"' (p. 15). 

The reader works with the sustained weaving together of parallel perspec 
tives and voices vested in the figures of Clarissa Dalloway, Peter Walsh and 
Septimus Smith. 'Character' is a complex and embedded entity which 
is realised in the connections between voices and focalisers. For instance, 
Peter Walsh recalls to memory a conversation with Clarissa in which she 
meditated on the problem of knowing other selves:

Woolf's narrative experimentation 123 

For how could they know each other! You met every day; then not for six 
months, or years. It was unsatisfactory, they agreed, how little one knew people. 
But she said, sitting on the bus going up Shaftesbury Avenue, she felt herself 
everywhere; not 'here, here, here'; and she tapped the back of the seat; but every/ 
where ... So that to know her, or any one, one must seek out the people who 
completed them; even the places. Odd affinities she had with people she had 
never spoken to. (p. 135) 

Here Peter's inner voice voice mediates his recollection of Clarissa's voice. 
Peter's interior monologue actually performs Clarissa's theory. Perhaps the 
key phrase in the passage which guides the reading of the novel is 'odd 
affinities'. For the novel's weaving of perspectives and voices refuses a neat 
closure, instead inviting the reader to see emotional and impressionistic 
affinities between Clarissa and Septimus: both experience revelatory insights 
into the forms of subjection and repression that they experience in their 
respective and very different social worlds during a June day, which ends 
openly for Clarissa with her society party still in full swing, and for Septimus 
in his suicide. It could be said that Mrs Dalloway is novelistic in a way 
not unlike Dickens's Bleak House. Unity of effect may be built upon the 
foregrounding of voice and the subjective movement of mind, and coherent 
narrative closure may be resisted, but Woolf's novel is still expansive, 
embracing a multiplicity of voices, and ambitiously seeking to represent 
hitherto unseen connections between divergent social and cultural worlds. 



4.14 Woolf's narrative experimentation in context 

Clarissa Dalloway 's reflections on the difficulty of knowing characters and 
other selves touch on a problem which many readers experience when read/ 
ing Mrs Dalloway. The narrative method implicitly refutes H. G. Wells's 
view (see section 4.8) which argued that models of character should be 
transparently available through the novel, the 'discursiveness' of which 
could authoritatively guide its readers during times of cultural change. Of 
course, Woolf's novel does not make character unknowable, because with 
effort the reader can still come to know Clarissa Dalloway, Peter Walsh and 
Septimus Smith intimately. Yet it does reframe the terms for representing and 
reading 'character'. This can be linked to Woolf's view that, in a period of 
social and cultural transition, human character itself was changing. She 
claimed as much in her literary/critical essay 'Mr Bennett and Mrs Brown', 
contending that human character changed in December 1910. Woolf's essay

also meditates on the relationship between narrative and power relations in 
ways which challenge Wells's theory and practice of novel writing. 

'Mr Bennett and Mrs Brown' is a generically hybrid production, some/ 
where between literary criticism and the short story. In the essay, Woolf 
recalls being on a train: sitting opposite her are a middle/aged man and an 
elderly lady; the latter is Mrs Brown. Woolf reports the dialogue that passes 
between these two figures, and goes on to try to imagine a resolution to the 
situation which she infers from the dialogue: at the centre of that resolution 
is Mrs Brown's life. 'What I want you to see in it,' insists Woolf, 'is this. Here 
is a character imposing itself upon another person. Here is Mrs Brown 
making someone begin almost automatically to write a novel about her.' 15 
Woolf argues that, at an imaginative level at least, Mrs Brown has imposed 
herself on Woolf and that, as a novelist, it is imperative for Woolf to recipro' 
cate responsibly, using techniques to situate Mrs Brown at the centre of her 
own story. It is the concept of imposition that we need to focus on, for the 
novelist can use it irresponsibly as a tool of domination. The 'Mr Bennett' 
of Woolf 's title refers to the novelist Arnold Bennett, a realist contemporary 
of Wells. Analysing one of Bennett's novels, and focusing on its central 
woman character, Woolf objects to the fact that 'we cannot hear . . . [her] 
voice; we can only hear Mr Bennett's voice telling us facts about rents 
and freeholds and copyholds and fines.' 46 In other words, Bennett's narrator 
'imposes' on the character, diminishing the significance of her subjectivity. 

We can use this critique of Bennett and the narrative discursiveness advo' 
cated by novelists such as Wells to make a connection with Mrs Dalloway; for 
that narrative, in addition to seeking to dramatise the voices of its characters, 
also explores the social technologies of imposition and domination that can 
result in the marginalisation of voice. These technologies are embodied in 
the patriarchal psychiatry of Sir William Bradshaw and his treatment of 
Septimus Smith's mental crisis. They are also present in regulatory mechan/ 
isms such as the clocks with which Bradshaw is associated, and which, led 
by Big Ben, symbolically impose their regime on the imperial capital ('the 
hour, irrevocable'). As we saw in our analysis of the opening of Mrs 
Dalloway (section 4.12), Woolf's narrative experiment seeks to perform 
versions of multi'layered subjective life experienced in the 'moment' 
precisely in opposition to this regime of linear time. Contemplating 'The 
Future of the Novel' in 1899, Henry James speculated that it might be a new 
generation of women novelists who would carry forward his hope for greater 
degrees of narrative experimentation. 47 Woolf and other narrative experi/

Notes 125 

mentalists such as Dorothy Richardson and May Sinclair were major 
innovators. Their gender was an important factor too: their innovations and 
experiments often took shape against social and cultural institutions which 
reinforced masculine authority while marginalising women. 

Writing to James Joyce in 1928, H. G. Wells thought there was a price to 
pay as the prose of the novel became less concerned to make 'language and 
statement as simple as possible', and more innovatory, poetical and distinc 
tive. Wells was certainly prepared to acknowledge the authority of 'the hour, 
irrevocable': 'Who the hell is this Joyce who demands so many of the waking 
hours of the few thousands I have still to live for a proper appreciation of his 
quirks and fancies and flashes of rendering?" 18 

It is not a negligible question, and it raises the issue of the cultural 
construction of the implied reader of this kind of narrative. Peter Keating 
has argued in The Haunted Study that the 'professional' reader is the most 
powerful legacy of this period of transition. Indeed, Mrs Dalloway implies 
a dutiful reader who is willing to be educated in its ways of constructing 
patterns, echoes and parallels from its detail. What we see, what we realise 
of ourselves as we read, is the emergence of new kind of implied reader: the 
academic reader and rcreader. It could be said that this reader was born not 
a moment too soon, given the challenges that the metafictional, postmodern 
and postcolonial narratives to be explored in the following and final chapter 
will pose. The paradox is that some of these narratives predate the birth of 
such a reader.

History, intertextuality and the carnivalised novel: 
postmodern conditions and postcolonial hybridities 



5.1 Playful narratives 

Virginia Woolf's early twentieth/century Mrs Dalloway (sections 4.12?14) 
poses interpretative challenges to its reader; Woolf claimed that the refined 
artistic rationale which shaped her experiments with narrative would take 
the novel beyond the tired and oppressive conventions of realism to grant the 
reader access to a deeper, more truthful account of life. Moving beyond this 
position to the later twentieth century, this concluding chapter will explore 
the 'metafictional' or 'postmodern' novel, which asks its reader to entertain 
instead more sceptical and playful questions about the relationship between 
narration and our knowledge of life, reality and history. 

The chapter will focus substantially on Salman Rushdie's Midnight's 
Children (1981), a novel about post/Independence India which can be read 
as a postmodern metafiction. In focusing on Midnight's Children as a particu/ 
lar kind of reading experience, the chapter will question the extent to which 
the source of its narrative energy can be explained with exclusive reference 
to late twentieth/century theories of postmodern scepticism and playfulness. 
It will argue that Midnight's Children is an example of what M. M. Bakhtin 
calls the 'carnivalised' novel, and as such participates in a much longer 
cross/cultural history. Consequently, exploring Midnight's Children in this 
light will necessitate a reverse from the 'forward march' of cultural history 
that has characterised this book so far. The chapter will return to the eiglv 
teenth century, and Laurence Sterne's masterpiece of carnival literature, 
Tristram Shandy. 

Sterne's novel will be the intertextual link to the other main topic which 
this chapter addresses in its discussion of Midnight's Children. Given that 
Rushdie's novel is about India and its modern history of decolonisation, it

130 History, intertextuality and the carnivalised novel 

can be read to reflect on the relations of power, domination and resistance 
that are present in the cross-cultural encounters which inhere in colonialism. 
Postcolonial criticism addresses such relations and asks: what kind of aware/ 
ness about contexts and intertexts do readers need to acquire to appreciate 
the way in which the narrative energy of Midnight's Children challenges and 
resists colonial power in the cultural field? Which cultural field do we mean? 
As we shall see, these are challenging but important questions. 

5.2 The novel as history, and the postmodern novel 
as metafiction 

When Henry James stated (in his essay on 'The Art of Fiction'; see section 
4.5) that 'the novel is history. That is the only general description ... that 
we may give of the novel', he articulated something that novelists had 
long recognised. 1 Eighteenth/century novels often described themselves as 
'histories' in their full titles (Richardson's Clarissa, Fielding's Tom Jones); and 
George Eliot's novels aspired to represent the 'incarnate history' embedded 
in the webs and relationships that comprised ordinary life (see section 3.12). 
Although Woolf's experimental Mrs Dalloway (see sections 4.12?14) 
rejected the realist conventions of narration that descended from Eliot, the 
recent events of World War I and the more distant past of the late Victorian 
world are senses of history that the reader can access and connect through 
the interstices between the orchestrated voices and perspectives. 

If we look to the novel in the later twentieth century, a solid sense of the 
past is something that narrative can no longer guarantee to deliver. For 
instance, John Fowles's novel The French Lieutenant's Woman (1969) is 
ostensibly an historical romance set in mid Victorian England. By the end of 
Chapter 12 the narrator has established a detailed picture of the topography 
of the novel's setting, Lyme Regis, as well as a coherent characterisation of 
his hero, Charles Smithson. But at this moment the narrator poses a question 
about his enigmatic heroine Sarah Woodruff: 

Who is Sarah; 

Out of which shadows does she come? 

At the beginning of Chapter 13, the narrator answers his own question: 

I do not know. The story I am telling is all imagination. These characters I create 
never existed outside my own mind. If I have pretended until now to know my 
characters' minds and innermost thoughts, it is because I am writing in (just as 
I have assumed some of the vocabulary and 'voice' of) a convention universally 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



31 



The novel as history 131 

accepted at the time of my story: that the novelist stands next to God. He may 
not know all, yet he tries to pretend that he does. But I live in the age of Alain 
Robbe/Grillet and Roland Barthes. 2 

The narrator is here engaging in metafictional commentary. 'Metafiction' 
names a practice that plays upon the conventional workings of fiction: 
'meta' means above, so metalanguages are languages that 'comment' on 
an object language. 'Metafiction' refers to a strain of self-reflexivity in a 
fiction which comments on the workings of that fiction and reflects, often 
sceptically, upon its relations to the social and historical world it claims to 
represent. This metafictional strategy lays bare and questions the convention 
of nineteenth/century omniscient narration which 'knows' both character 
and history (see the discussion of George Eliot's omniscient narrative voice 
in section 3.13). 

In naming Alain Robbe/Grillet and Roland Barthes, Fowles alludes to 
the later twentieth/century movements which have shaped his metafictional 
impulse. First, Alain Robbe/Grillet pioneered the French New Novel of 
the 1950s and 1960s, which experimented with, and radically subverted, 
orthodox narrative conventions for constructing time schemes, coherent 
focalisers, voices and characters. And second, the cultural theorist and 
semiotician Roland Barthes employed the methods of structuralism and 
poststructuralism to question the characteristically nineteenth/century epis' 
temological foundations on which these conventions had been built. Barthes 
claimed that pre/structuralist literary criticism ? of the kind that we have 
seen exemplified in Selden Whitcomb's early twentieth/century study of the 
novel (see sections 1.5, 1.8) ? operated on the basis of these same epistemo' 
logical foundations. An example of their shaping power on the realist novel 
can be found in the discussion of Eliot in section 3.5. Barthes argued against 
this epistemology by claiming that what we think we 'know' transparently 
as 'law'/governed social and material reality is always already encoded in 
sign systems and narratives. 3 Fowles's point is that his narrative can merely 
parody the conventions of the nineteenth/century realist novel because his 
writing has been shaped by discourses which question the authority and 
transcendence of the means at our disposal for gaining access to the 'depth' 
of character, or the 'truth' of the past. We could say that Fowles's narrative 
confronts consequences of the multi'faceted 'postmodern condition'. 

The postmodern condition is conceived as, variously, the latest and even 
more intense episode in the long history of economic and social modern/ 
isation; a theory of the fragmentation of knowledge following a collapse of

132 History, intertextuality and the carnivalised novel 

the strategies that have traditionally been used to legitimate it; and the theory 
and practice of art in contemporary culture which, in the field of narrative 
art, has been realised in fictions which share many of the self-reflexive 
features of metafictional narratives. It would be wrong to state that there 
is such a thing as the 'exemplary' postmodern novel or fiction. If post/ 
modernism as a social and cultural phenomenon resists one single expla/ 
nation, it follows that there must be many kinds of postmodern fiction. 

These include, on the one hand, the multi'layered works of late twentieth/ 
century American fiction writers such as Robert Coover and Paul Auster, 
which reflexively interrogate the terms in which written stories relate to life. 
For instance, in Paul Auster's City of Glass (1985), the central character, 
Daniel Quinn, is a New York/based writer of detective fictions who gets 
mistaken for a 'real' detective called 'Paul Auster'. Masquerading as 'Paul 
Auster' the detective, Quinn seeks to protect his client from the threat of 
murder by following and interpreting the actions of the elderly suspect, who 
wanders the streets of New York picking up and collecting unrelated objects 
and fragments, seemingly arbitrarily. Quinn literally 'traces' in a notebook 
the suspect's movements, which, when rendered graphically, could be read 
as alphabetical letters forming words which signal, in code, a possible 
intention to commit murder. However, Quinn could simply be writing 
significance into completely arbitrary movements, as the suspect 'had not left 
his message anywhere. True, he had created the letters by the movements of 
his steps, but they had not been written down ... And yet, the pictures did 
exist ? not in the streets where they had been drawn, but in Quinn's red 
notebook.' 4 This dilemma is impossible to decide definitively when set in the 
context of other narrative layers: the suspect is collecting objects in order 
to fashion a new theory of language which will reestablish the broken 
relationship between words and things. Moreover, when Quinn seeks the 
real 'Paul Auster' to help him with the baffling case Auster turns out not to 
be a detective, but another writer from New York. During their meeting 
Auster discusses his latest piece of writing concerned with the problem of 
who narrates Cervantes's early novel, Don Quixote (1605). This is a problem 
which the narration of City of Glass itself performs, given that 'Paul Auster' 
is just another character in the tale, 'disowned' by the narrator at its end: As 
for Auster, I am convinced he behaved badly throughout.' Auster's post/ 
modern fictions pose questions about the relationship between writing and 
life, asking the reader to consider the extent to which significance, meaning 
and control may be established in either.

Midnight's Children as 'historiographic metafiction' 133 

On the other hand, in another kind of postmodern novel which has come 
to be known as the historiographic metafiction, the authority of historical 
knowledge ? the form of knowledge rendered most vulnerable by the col/ 
lapse of legitimating strategies ? is playfully scrutinised and questioned. In 
order to illustrate the complex of relations that I have started to outline in my 
initial approach to the postmodern condition, I shall move to a discussion of 
Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children. 

5.3 Midnight's Children as postmodern 'historiographic 
metafiction': sniffy incredulity towards metanarratives 

In what sense can Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children be read as a post/ 
modern historiographic metafiction? The moment of birth of the novel's 
narrator and main character, Saleem Sinai, coincides precisely with the 
moment of Indian independence from England (midnight, 15 August 
1947), a fact about time and chronology which he records haltingly ('spell it 
out, spell it out') making much of the clock/hands which 'joined palms in 
respectful greeting as I came'.' Saleem goes on to 'confide' chaotically his life 
story from the Bombay pickle factory where he works. The narrative frame/ 
work incorporates devices that we have seen in early fictions such as Pamela; 
Padma is Saleem's narratee, but at this moment (Book 2, Chapter 4), she has 
abandoned Saleem, who confesses to a confusion and disorientation which 
are a feature of his narration: 

Reality is a question of perspective; the further you get from the past, the more 
concrete and plausible it seems ? but as you approach the present, it inevitably 
seems more and more incredible. Suppose yourself in a large cinema, sitting at 
first in the back row, and gradually moving up, row by row, until your nose is 
almost pressed against the screen. Gradually the stars' faces dissolve into the 
dancing grain; tiny details assume grotesque proportions; the illusion dissolves ? 
or rather, it becomes clear that the illusion is reality . . . we have come from 1915 
to 1956, so we're a good deal closer to the screen ... abandoning my metaphor, 
then, I reiterate, entirely without a sense of shame, my unbelievable claim: after 
a curious accident in the washing chest, I became a sort of radio. 

But today I feel confused ... a little confusion is surely permissible in these

The assassination of Mahatma Gandhi occurs, in these pages, on the wrong 
date. I cannot say, now, what the actual sequence of events might have been; in 
my India, Gandhi will continue to die at the wrong time. (pp. 165?6) 

There are a number of points that we can make about this passage that place

it in the context of contemporary positions which seek to articulate a sense 
of the postmodern and its relationship to narrative. 

First, Saleem locates the story in the year 1956. Postmodernity has a social 
and economic frame of reference and for historical sociologists such as Daniel 
Bell, the postmodern era is a post/1945, or post/ World War II, phenomenon. 
It is argued that postmodern economies are characterised by a shift from 
production and goods/based economics to those based on the supply of 
services and information. This has implications for the human subject's 
experience of everyday life, which becomes increasingly saturated by the 
effects of this transformation. Bell was writing at a time (1976) which 
permitted him to generalise about the artistic phenomenon which came to be 
known as 'Modernism', the experimental forms of which we explored in 
sections 4.11 and 4.12?14. Bell argues that Modernist art tended to create 
a cultural space in which individual perception and imagination were 
celebrated as minority forms of artistic resistance to the technological im/ 
positions of modernisation. Under postmodern culture, the human subject's 
imaginative life is increasingly indistinguishable from the new forms of 
consumption. 6 It is notable that in reaching for metaphors to account for 
himself and his own curious powers ? hiding in the laundry basket, Saleem 
has suffered an accident to his sinuses which is causing him to hear voices in 
his head ? he draws upon the modern communication technology of the 
radio. 

The other modern communication technology present here is, of course, 
cinema; cinema helps Saleem to understand his interpretative relationship to 
the present and the past (the story begins in 1915 with Saleem's grandfather, 
Aadam Aziz). But the cinematic metaphor is a comment on the way in 
which reality is perspectival and constructed: 'reality', when you get close 
up, is as illusory as the images which turn out to be nothing other than the 
grain of a projected celluloid frame. This brings us to a dimension of the 
postmodern condition elaborated by the French sociologist and philosopher 
Jean Baudrillard. Baudrillard argues that, in the light of a move from a 
production/based society to an information/ and image/ led society, the 
distinction between representations and things has blurred, and image or 
the 'simulacrum' has grown in power. 7 At this point postmodernism and 
metafictional practice conjoin: after all, if there are no longer clear/cut dis/ 
tinctions between things and images, the whole idea of a fiction finds itself 
in an expanded empire of possibilities. Consequently, narrative is given 
licence to reflect not only on its own constructed and relative status, but also

Midnight's Children as 'historiographic metafiction' 135 

on the implications that this has for apparently 'real' domains of authority 
and knowledge. 

History is, of course, a major domain of authoritative knowledge, and 
it is in respect of one of the events of public history ? the assassination of 
Gandhi ? that Saleem's narrative acknowledges itself to be subjective and 
fictional: chronologically, he gets the date wrong, but 'in my India, Gandhi 
will continue to die at the wrong time'. Linda Hutcheon describes gestures 
such as this as a 'historiographic metafiction', a concept which traces the 
generic similarities between narrative fictions and narrative histories (history 
as a form of knowledge exists primarily in written, narrativised forms, 
known as historiography). 8 'Metafictions' of this variety prompt us to see the 
possibility that histories of a public, professional kind are, of their nature, as 
materially fictional or 'made' as novels. This is a perspective that has been 
brought to the debate about postmodernity by Hayden White's theory of the 
'metahistorical' nature of historiographical narration. In White's view, 
there is always a linguistic dimension to historical narration, which makes 
the view of the past one narrates an effect of the combination of tropes, 
or figures of speech, one chooses to use, rather than the 'truth' of what 
happened. 9 Saleem actually reflects on the way in which such linguistic 
choices and combinations have determined his representation of himself as 
an 'agent' in history: 

How, in what terms, may the career of a single individual be said to impinge 
on the fate of a nation? I must answer in adverbs and hyphens: I was linked to 
history both literally and metaphorically; both actively and passively, in what our 
(admirably modern) scientists might term 'modes of connection' composed of 
'dualisticallycombined configurations' of the two pairs of opposed adverbs 
given above. This is why hyphens are necessary: actively/literally, passively/ 
metaphorically, activelymetaphorically and passivelyliterally, I was inextricably 
entwined with my world, (p. 238) 

Saleem's expression of his relationship to history in terms of a language 
game inspired by modern science links Rushdie's novel to another dimen/ 
sion of the postmodern condition, elaborated this time by the French 
philosopher Jean/Franjois Lyotard. Lyotard has argued that postmodernity 
is characterised by the proliferation of specialised and incommensurable 
'language games'; the consequent fragmentation of knowledge has resulted 
in a widespread 'incredulity towards metanarratives'. By 'metanarratives' 
Lyotard means those great, public, secular histories, or master narratives, 
which sustained faith in humanity's progress to freedom and liberation

throughout the nineteenth century and the earlier part of the twentieth. 10 
Such master narratives imply origins from which a linear movement develops, 
so the reader's 'incredulity' towards narrative in general in Midnight's Children 
is shaped by the digressive story of Saleem's origins. For these turn out to be 
bogus: or, at least, not explicable in terms of the story that the narration 
appears to establish, for the story continually turns back on itself. 

Saleem has barely begun his narration before he is alluding to his nick/ 
names, which include 'Snotnose' and 'Sniffer', and which indicate that 
Saleem has a very large nose. He owes his job in the pickle factory to his acute 
sense of smell. From the point of view of our reading tactics the nose is out 
in front, we might say. It remains out in front as Saleem returns to his origins 
by telling the story of his grandfather Aadam Aziz, a Western/educated 
Muslim doctor from Kashmir. Aadam Aziz's nose is prominent in two 
senses. First, and like Saleem's, it is very large. Second, it features in the 
events of public history with which Aadam's story is enmeshed: a timely 
sneeze throws him to the ground, saving him from death during General 
Dyer's brutal massacre of the Indian population of Amritsar in April 1919 
(p. 36). In Aadam and Saleem's noses the reader is being invited to trace a 
narrative line which traces 'origins', 'heredity' and 'descent'. However, this 
code has effectively to be erased by the reader when Saleem reveals that he is 
not, biologically, from Aadam Aziz's family line at all. Instead, he has been 
planted in Aadam Aziz's daughter's arms when mischievously swapped at 
birth with the child of an accordion player, Wee Willy Winkie, and his 
wife. But the new story of Saleem's 'origins' is reversed again: Saleem reveals 
that Wee Willy Winkie is not actually his biological father, for he has been 
illegitimately sired by William Methwold, one of the last representatives of 
English colonialism in Bombay (who, to complicate matters further, is of 
AngkvFrench extraction). The story about Saleem's origin and descent is 
undermined by a number of self-consciously staged narrative reversals. In 
a metafictional comment Saleem conceptually reverses the reader's core 
assumptions about our origins and the stories we tell of them when he speaks 
of his powers of invention in 'giving birth to fathers and mothers' (p. 108). 

Saleem has, given his origins, a precarious hold on identity, and this 
returns us to the place where we started: Saleem's reflections on the illusory 
nature of reality. At this point in his narration his identity is made up of 
different characters and objects derived from an amalgam of modern and 
archaic narratives; he is not only India's Child of Midnight, the hope for the 
future validated in a letter from India's new prime minister, Nehru; but also

a radio who 'receives' the sound of voices; and, in another version, the new 
prophet Mohammed, who hears voices and 'sought and received reassur/ 
ance from wife and friends: "verily", they told him, "you are the messenger 
of God" '(p. 163). 

Saleem hears voices and tells his father that archangels are speaking to 
him: his father takes him to be jesting in bad taste and knocks him to the 
ground, which he hits after falling through a glass/topped table. Saleem is of 
course cut: but readers who approach the text from the perspective of the 
postmodern may already have recognised Saleem's cuts and splits as being 
more than skin deep. Saleem is 'split' in the sense of being schizoid, a subject 
who is not at one with himself: 'Please believe me that I am falling apart' 
(p. 37). Theories of the postmodern argue that the human subject is, with 
varying degrees of acknowledgement, split, or pulled between multiple 
points of identification. If the narrated self is only ever a fiction, or some/ 
thing that is made ? our analysis of Richardson's Pamela (Chapter 2) stressed 
the way in which Pamela 'makes' herself through writing ? then Saleem's 
self parades its splits and contradictions, and has dispensed with the illusory 
fiction of 'coherence'. 



5.4 The novel as national fiction: postcolonial concerns 

How far should one pursue this postmodern reading of Midnight's Children 
as historiographic metafiction? Clearly there is a strong basis to it, but the 
difficulty with this reading is that whilst it can account for history and 
subjectivity as abstract problems, it has not said very much about the specifi/ 
cally Indian content of Rushdie's novel, for Saleem's story is interwoven 
with the history of India in the twentieth century, and is organised around 
actual events (even if it gets the chronology of some of those events wrong, 
like the assassination of Gandhi): the struggle for independence, the partition 
of the continent into India and Pakistan, the language riots, the India- 
Pakistan war. It should not be assumed that theories formulated in the West 
about social and economic development, the collapse of legitimating grand 
narratives, and split subjectivity can be grafted onto a narrative about quite 
different historical and cultural experiences. We need some additional tools 
and we shall, consequently, need to turn to a form of critical discourse which 
engages more directly with the 'fate of a nation' theme which Saleem's nar/ 
ration manifestly pursues. 

Selden Whitcomb's 1906 book on the study of the novel (see Chapter 1) 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



38 



138 History, intertextuality and the carnivalised novel 

equated the development of the novel with the modern nation. For 
Whitcomb, the novel was an expression of 'national consciousness', and 
Whitcomb saw novelists who shared a language at particular moments of 
history, such as 'the eighteenth/century English realists', expressing 'the 
unity of a national school'. Whitcomb held that even 'in the individual 
novelist, national consciousness has often been pronounced'. 11 

Benedict Anderson and Timothy Brennan, writing in the late twentieth 
century, continue to see a vital connection between the novel and the nation: 
for these historians of culture the novel, along with the newspaper, was a 
central component in the powerful 'national print medias', a technology at 
the heart of developing European nation states in the nineteenth century (see 
section 4.4). Whereas for Whitcomb the novel was determined by, and an 
expression of, 'national consciousness', Anderson and Brennan argue that 
the influence ran in the opposite direction. They remind us that Germany, 
for instance, was a loose confederation of principalities in the early nine/ 
teenth century (Germany did not unify until 1870). They point out that the 
novel became a powerful cultural medium in the first decades of the nine/ 
teenth century, precisely the point at which German Romantic scholars were 
'discovering' unifying national origins in folk traditions. It was the novel 
which played a strategic role in creating the nation in the form of an 
'imagined community'. We saw the impact of this on a British context in 
the brief discussion of Scott's national/historical novel Waverky and its 
influence on Eliot's fiction, which itself attempted imaginatively to grasp the 
totality of the 'nation' (see section 3.13). As Brennan has argued, summar/ 
ising Anderson's thesis, the novel was a print medium which assisted in this 
construction of a sense of continuity and belonging in that it: 

created the conditions where people could begin to think of themselves as a 
nation. The novel's created world allowed for multitudinous actions occurring 
simultaneously within a single, definable community . . . Read in isolation, the 
novel was nevertheless a mass ceremony; one could read alone with the 
conviction that millions of others were doing so at the same time. 

In practice, the unity of the European nation states was as fictional ? that 
is to say constructed ? as the novel. The novel was a fiction in which readers 
pleasurably invested time and intellectual energy; it assisted in making 
imaginary European nations into politically and civicly sustainable entities. 
In addition, the forms of 'national consciousness' which the novel en/ 
gendered played a role in legitimating overseas colonial activity mounted in

a nation's name. We saw in Chapter 3 how Jane Eyre concludes with Jane's 
allusion to the missionary zeal of St John Rivers 'hew[ing] ... down the 
prejudices of creed and caste' in colonial India (I shall return to this theme 
in section 5.7). " 

A critical approach to a late twentieth/century novel about a territory 
releasing itself from the shackles of colonialism can take these observations 
as a starting point. Rushdie's novel is set in India: specifically, an India that 
is having to invent itself as an independent nation after almost three centuries 
of English colonialism. As a 'postcolonial' story, Midnight's Children was 
praised ? as the cover/blurb tells us ? by the New York Times for sounding 
'like a continent finding its voice'. In what sense is Saleem the 'voice' of the 
Eastern subcontinent? Saleem's identification with the narrative traditions of 
the Orient is clear when he likens himself to Scheherazade, the inner/frame 
narrator of the ancient collection of tales comprising the Arabian Nights, 
who each night has to tell a new story to King Shahryar in an effort to defer 
her execution (pp. 9, 24). In addition, Saleem alludes to figures from Hindu 
myths and folklore throughout his narration (Shiva, Parvati, Ganesh) and 
the extent to which, even though a Muslim, he is 'well up in them' (p. 149). 
And Saleem's opposition to the linearity of chronological history may have 
less to do with the postmodernism of Lyotard than with the Indian concept 
of Maya, a dynamic 'dream/web' to which he alludes (pp. 406, 194), and 
which, in the emphasis it gives to the illusoriness of visible life, presents 
history in mythical terms, as rhythmic cycles of Yugas or vast aeons of 
time: 14 

Think of this: history, in my version, entered a new phase on August 15th, 1947 
? but in another version, that inescapable date is no more than one fleeting 
moment in an Age of Darkness, Kali/Yuga, in which the cow of morality has 
been reduced to standing, teetering, on a single leg! Kali/Yuga . . . began on 
Friday, February 18th, 3102 B.C.; and will last a mere 432,000 years! Already 
feeling somewhat dwarfed, I should add, nevertheless that the Age of Darkness 
is only the fourth phase of the present Maha^Yuga cycle, which is, in total, ten 
times as long. (p. 194) 

Finally, the novel presents Saleem as not only an internally 'split' subject, 
but also a subject caught between warring linguistic communities in an 
India that was paradoxically subdividing in order to maintain unity. Saleem 
recollects 1955, the year in which the new nation was divided into fourteen 
states and six centrally administered territories: 'But the boundaries of these 
states were not formed by rivers, or mountains, or any natural features of the

terrain; they were, instead, walls of words. Language divided us' (p. 189). 
These reflections on India's linguistic heterogeneity, and before that on the 
mythic cosmology of Maya, are instructive moments which can take us into 
postcolonial criticism's quarrel with certain trends in postmodernist novel 
reading. Vijay Mishra and Bob Hodge argue that: 

For postmodernism, Rushdie's questioning of historical certainties is exemplary 
of its own project; for the post'colonial what is important is the way in which 
another, lost master/narrative recalled through the creative power of tnaya, of 
illusion, is used to free the colonized . . . Whereas a postmodern reading of 
Midnight's Children would emphasise play and deferral, a fully post/colonial 
reading will locate the meaning of the untranslated words and the special, 
culture/specific resonances of the text. 1 

The most important point about a postcolonial criticism is that it insists 
on cultural specificity: words are walls, not in the sense that they erect in/ 
surmountable points of resistance, but because they mark out a particular 
cultural territory. Whilst postmodern theories of language and subjectivity 
foreground splits, difference and heterogeneity, Mishra and Hodge imply 
that in being assimilated into a particular style of novel criticism, these 
theories have tended to emphasise a repetitive sameness in the texts they 
address: metafictional playfulness, a questioning of history, and narrative 
deferral and reversal. Accordingly, one might read Rushdie's Midnight's 
Children in much the same way as one might read Graham Swift's Waterlani 
(1983), a complex, convoluted, first/person narrative about family history 
and historical knowledge, though in this instance set in the fens of eastern 
England. Against this levelling out of experience, Mishra and Hodge 
propose that the novel shaped by colonial experience and location, and the 
postcolonial criticism that practices upon it, should aim to support one 
another towards advancing a political end: 'free the colonized.' The post/ 
colonial novel may begin to achieve this through its specific and alien range 
of cultural reference, which halts the Western reader's easy assimilation of 
the usual range reference which makes a novel, in Raymond Williams's 
phrase, a 'knowable community'. 

Do such cultural specificities as the magical narrative of Maya account for 
the 'narrative energy' of Midnight's Children as Mishra and Hodge claim? In 
part of course they do, but we need to remember that it is written in English 
by an author who, although of Indian/Muslim origin, was also educated in 
England, and who is familiar with Anglo/European fictional traditions. 
One of the features of postmodernism is a raiding of the past for things to

appropriate in the present. We need to bear this in mind when we think 
about the particular novelistic discourse and intertextual affiliations which 
Rushdie has used to fashion Saleem's 'voice'. 

S.S The discourse of Midnight's Children in 'long' 

cross-cultural history: Laurence Sterne's Tristram 
Shandy as eighteenth/century metafiction 

Consequently our approach will need to do more than supplement a post/ 
modern reading with a corrective postcolonial range of reference. We shall 
also need to think intertextually about the particular novelistic discourse in 
which Rushdie's Midnight's Children is written. It belongs, as we shall see, 
to a discourse with a long cross/cultural history, for it is not the case that 
metafictionally self-referential and self-reversing narratives are exclusively a 
feature of the postmodern condition of the later twentieth century. What is 
the nature of this discourse? Saleem, in telling the reader that he is 'falling 
apart', qualifies his remark: 'I am not speaking metaphorically ... my poor 
body . . . has started coming apart at the seams' (p. 37). We will need to come 
back to Saleem's body, and there will be no escaping his nose. To do this we 
shall explore Bakhtin's history of the novel, which foregrounds the body as 
a figure of discourse with powerful and long/established comic/grotesque 
resonances. This will entail our own 'reversal' from the 'forward' movement 
of literary and cultural history that we have been pursuing so far in this 
book: we shall return to the eighteenth century, to Laurence Sterne's Tristram 
Shandy (1760-7), as well as to some of its precursors. This can help us 
to understand Midnight's Children as a carnivalised, parodic novel. Such a 
'digression' can help to provide an intertextual context which can assist in 
shaping a revised postcolonial reading of the novel. 

The full title of Sterne's novel is The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, 
Gentleman; it began to appear just twenty years after Richardson's Pamela. 
The narrator is Tristram Shandy, and his ostensible aim is to tell his life story. 
This aim remains hilariously unfulfilled because the narrator's 'opinions', 
indeed opinions in general, keep interrupting and deferring the events of the 
life that the narrator strives to recount. The narrative begins with strict 
chronological propriety, the narration of the first 'event' of Tristram's life 
being his conception. Yet this is plagued by interruption: first Walter 
Shandy's act of coitus is interrupted by his wife's observation that he has 
forgotten to wind the clock. The narration of this event is then interrupted

42 



142 History, intertextuality and the carnivalised novel 

by Tristram, who offers an opinion as to the problem which his mother's 
interruption caused to his own development from the 'homunculous' state, 
a reflection which leads Tristram to 'tremble to think what a foundation had 
been laid for a thousand weaknesses both of body and mind'. 16 Tristram's 
bodily infirmities are most immediately evident in his damaged nose, which, 
as the reader discovers in volume III of his narrative (there are nine volumes 
in all), was flattened by forceps during his birth. This becomes an occasion 
for a long digression into Walter Shandy's obsession with physiognomical 
theories of noses and all they imply about the decline in fortunes that his 
family has experienced. This is Walter's 'hobby horse'. Tristram's uncle 
Toby's 'hobby horse' is the groin wound inflicted on him at the Battle of 
Namur, and his subsequent efforts to reconstruct the event on his bowling 
lawn: this comes to occupy a greater part of the narrative than Tristram's 
story. The narration of Tristram's subsequent history is further deferred by 
Tristram's metacommentary on the justification for beginning his narrative 
with his conception: 

right glad I am, that I have begun the history of myself in the way I have done; 
and that I am able to go on tracing every thing in it, as Horace says, ah Ovo. 
[trans, 'from the egg'] 

Horace, I know, does not recommend this fashion altogether: But that 
gentlelman is speaking only of an epic poem or a tragedy; ? (I forget which) ? 
besides, if it was not so, I should beg Mr Horace's pardon; ? for in writing what 
I have set about, I shall confine myself neither to his rules, nor to any man's rules 
that ever lived, (p. 38) 

The allusion is to Horace, the Roman classical literary critic, who praised 
Homer for beginning the epic Iliad in medias res. The precise meaning of the 
allusion is less important than Tristram's attitude to the 'rules' of critical 
propriety: he declares that he will not be bound by rules. 

Indeed, Tristram's narration operates as a kind of metafictional com/ 
mentary which breaks rules in order to lay bare and question generic 
conventions. When he offers an opinion on biography, he argues that only 
biographies of an imagined race of people from the intensely hot planet 
Mercury might actually be possible because, reasoning on the basis of 
efficient causes and final causes, only their bodies could be sufficiently 
transparent to reveal what is inside them. This is a parody which has two 
objects. The first object is eighteenth/century scientific rationalism, the 
reasoning processes of which are mockingly imitated. This leads to the 
second and main object, which questions the expectations associated with 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



43 



Midnight's Children in 'long' cross-cultural history 143 

prose which claims to show the reader the 'truth' of character. For Tristram 
argues that 'our minds shine not through the body, but are wrapped up here 
in a dark covering of uncrystallized flesh and blood' (pp. 96?7). Sterne may 
not be writing in the age of RobbcGrillet and Barthes, but we could say 
that this anticipates Fowles's late twentieth/century metafictional question/ 
ing of the conventions for 'revealing' character in narrative (see section 5.2). 
Tristram also writes a metacommentary on the representation of time. 
Recalling the ever/deferred events leading up to his birth, he writes: 

It is about an hour and a half's tolerable good reading since my uncle Toby rung 
the bell, when Obadiah [servant] was ordered to saddle a horse, and go for Dr 
Slop, the man/midwife; ? so that no one can say, with reason, that I have not 
allowed Obadiah enough time, poetically speaking ... both to go and come; ? 
though morally and truly speaking, the man, perhaps, has scarce had time to get 
on his boots. 

If the hypercritic will go upon this; and is resolved after all to to take a 
pendulum, and measure the true distance betwixt the ringing of the bell and the 
rap at the door; ? and after rinding it to be no more than two minutes, thirteen 
seconds, and three/fifths, ? should take upon him to insult me for such a breach 
in the unity, or rather probability, of time; ? I would remind him, that the idea 
of duration and of its simple modes, is got merely from the train and succession 
of our ideas, ? and is the true scholastic pendulum, ? and by which, as a scholar, 
I will be tried in this matter, ?adjuring and detesting the jurisdiction of all other 
pendulums whatever ... and that whilst Obadiah has been going those said 
miles and back, I have brought my uncle Toby from Namur, quite across all 
Flanders, into England ... (pp. 112?13) 

This metacommentary is concerned again with time, and the relationship 
between duration in narrative and duration in life. In our very first reading 
of narrative {Emma; see section 2.4), we saw that duration was a category of 
analysis, in the sense that narration regularly and conventionally condenses 
chronological time into summaries. Tristram Shandy foregrounds duration as 
a problem here and elsewhere: famously, Tristram, upon reaching the middle 
of his fourth volume, reflects that, in terms of lived composition time, it has 
taken him a year to narrate the first day of his life and, consequently, there are 
three hundred and sixty/four more days to narrate than there were when he 
started to write: 'the more I write, the more I shall have to write' (p. 286). 
Recalling when Tristram Shandy was written (the middle of the eighteenth 
century), at one level Sterne is parodying Richardson's concern with writing 
'to the moment' (see section 2.9). At another level, according to the early 
twentieth/century Russian Formalist literary critic Victor Shklovsky,

144 History, intertextuality and the carnivalised novel 

Tristram Shandy has universal importance as a novel in that it 'lays bare' the 
devices of conventional narrative. 17 

But there is another way of reading the passage above which highlights 
the different domains of knowledge that the narrative brings together for 
the reader to experience and judge between. Tristram's metacommentary 
concedes that there are different epistemological conventions for accounting 
for the passage of time. His allusion to the unity of time can be read as 
a reference to Aristotle's theory of the unities as applied to mimetic arts 
(Aristotle argued that time systems need to be internally consistent to 
support dramatic effect). But Tristram also has recourse to the more scientific 
notion of probability, which measures the passing of time mechanically and 
objectively. The 'pendulum' which Tristram proposes to take as his standard 
is from the domain of philosophical speculation. It derives from the 
seventeenth/century empirical philosophy of John Locke, who argued, in 
the Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690), that our knowledge is 
derived from sensations which the mind receives as ideas (see section 2.12). 
These ideas, initially simple, are named, conventionally but otherwise arbi/ 
trarily, by language and combined into more complex ideas and associations 
of ideas: our sense of the passage of time is, then, shaped by the associated 
ideas we have of it, and their 'train and succession' in the subjective shifting 
movements of mind: a mental process which the narrative deferrals and 
digressions of Tristram Shandy dramatises. 

If this sounds like a narrative effect more suited to Modernist experimen/ 
tation or postmodern scepticism then we should bear in mind that, although 
seventeenth/ and eighteenth/century empiricist philosophies sought to 
advance the spread of reason and universal understanding, they could 
also be pushed into positions of extreme subjectivism and scepticism. For 
instance, the eighteenth/century philosopher David Hume, starting from 
Locke's theories, entertained the possibility that there was no transcendent 
entity called 'the self which was independent of the bundle of sensations 
that an individual subject was receiving through the senses. 'Coherent' 
experiences of selfhood in time are maintained by conventions which pro/ 
duce fictions of continuity in the form of memory. Thus, in addition to its 
parodic metafictional questioning of conventions for knowing character, 
Tristram's narration also questions the basis on which the events of history 
can be definitively known and linked, and the truth of the past accessed and 
agreed upon. 

Tristram Shandy exposes the reader to a comic sense of the vibrant

philosophical and rhetorical disputation which characterised eighteenth/ 
century culture. Moreover, it should be apparent that features which we 
initially marked out as distinctive characteristics of the postmodern con/ 
dition of the late twentieth century in sections 5.2?3 ? the incoherence of the 
self or subject, scepticism about history, incommensurable language games 
? were concerns too for Sterne, who also responded to them through parodic 
and metafictional narrative strategies. 18 Sterne's novel is highly allusive, and 
among his allusions are citations of even earlier writers such as the Greek 
satirist Lucian and the French Renaissance humanist Franjois Rabelais 
(p. 201). These writers ? especially Rabelais ? have been significant for 
Mikhail Bakhtin's subversive account of the development of the novel; it is 
to Bakhtin's work that we should now turn. 



5.6 Bakhtin's 'carnivalised' narrative: a 'second line 
of development' for the novel 

Bakhtin argues that the novel has a long cross/cultural history: his account 
of the nineteenth/century Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky explains 
features of his narratives by tracing them to antiquity and their origins in 
very different cultural settings. Bakhtin argued that the novel developed in 
antiquity 'in an epoch of intense struggle amongst numerous and hetero/ 
geneous religious and philosophical schools and movements, when disputes 
over "ultimate questions" of world view had become an everyday mass 
phenomenon among all strata of the population'. In other words, the results, 
such as Lucian's satires, were 'full of overt and hidden polemics with various 
philosophical, religious ... and scientific schools'." Lucian's narratives 
satirised contests between warring knowledges much in the way that 
Sterne's Tristram Shandy would in eighteenth/century England. 

Rabelais, the other author frequently cited by Tristram in Sterne's novel, 
is centrally important to Bakhtin's account. Rabelais 's Gargantua and Pantagruel 
was published in France in the 1530s but became widely known all over 
Europe. Gargantua and Pantagruel are not realist 'individual' characters 
but are instead fantastical grotesques who link together a multiplicity of 
comic narrative episodes: they are father/and/son giants whose stories parody 
royal genealogies, theological education, medical discourse, travel writing 
and much besides. For Bakhtin, the main significance of Rabelais's work 
was the very reason why it is often viewed as a work in bad taste: its recog' 
nition of the body's dependence on food, its need to deposit excrement, its 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



46 



146 History, intertextuality and the carnivalised novel 

desire to reproduce, and the laughter that these and the body's various related 
protuberances and orifices can generate. 

Bakhtin traces this poetics of the body to ancient and irreverent traditions 
of folk culture. According to him, grotesque humour has been shaped by 
the peasant culture of festivals in which authority relations were reversed and 
there were no divisions between performers and spectators. For Bakhtin this 
tradition became the essence of 'carnival' in Christian medieval Europe, 
where, although it was licensed by the church, it subverted the church's 
seriousness and dogmatic authority. According to Bakhtin, Rabelais 
fashions this deeply ambivalent but lifcaffirming humour into prose which 
parodies serious and authoritarian knowledge. In a reading of the prologue 
to Pantagruel Bakhtin notes how the prose is double-edged, located at once in 
'low' and 'high' culture: 

Therefore, to make an end to my prologue, I offer myself, body and soul, tripe 
and bowels, to a hundred thousand basket/loads of fine devils in case I lie in so 
much as a single word in the whole of this History. And, similarly, may St 
Anthony's fire burn you, the epilepsy throw you, the thunderstroke and leg 
ulcers rack you, dysentery seize you, the erysipelas, with its tiny cow/hair rash, 
and quicksilver's pain on top, through your arse-hole enter up, and like Sodom 
and Gomorrah may you dissolve into sulphur, fire, and the bottomless pit, in case 
you do not believe everything that I tell you in this present Chronicle]' 

We should note that this is a prelude to the history of Pantagruel, thereby 
raising the question of truth, untruth and belief, in common with all the 
narratives we are examining in this chapter. The language is excremental 
and bodily ('tripe' and 'arse/hole'), at once replete with insults and oaths 
reminiscent of the marketplace (a form of language known as 'billings/ 
gate'), whilst being also 'a parody and travesty of the ecclesiastical method 
of persuasion'. Bakhtin's point is that Christian dogma and the 'historical' 
narratives which legitimised it are the objects of this parody: 'behind the 
"Chronicles" stands the Gospels ... the exclusiveness of the church's 
truth'. 21 

But how does a Bakhtinian reading get from here to a reconsideration of 
the question of the long, cross-cultural history of a certain practice of novel 
writing? Bakhtin sees 'carnivalised' narrative of the kind performed in 
Tristram Shandy as a frequently overlooked yet powerful generic tradition 
in its own right in the history of the novel and prose narrative. Bakhtin 
acknowledges that the best'known line of development in the novel is the 
tradition which focuses on realism, sentiment and bildung (essentially that

47 



Bakhtin's 'carnivalised' narrative 147 

of the novels which we examined in Chapters 2 and 3 ? Pamela, Emma, Jane 
Eyre, Mill on the Floss). Bakhtin's view of the novel is not primarily mimetic: 
it is discursive, arguing that the novel is not a reflection or 'picture' of its 
times but, instead, a representation of all the social and cultural voices of its 
era. 22 Bakhtin called the multiplicity of voices that made up a language 
'heteroglossia'. In emphasising language, his account of the novel finds 
parallels with the work of Nancy Armstrong (see sections 2.14?15), who 
argued that the novel of sentiment and domestic desire developed in part out 
of a displaced political struggle and, linked to that struggle, debates about 
the cultural propriety of certain kinds of language use. Bakhtin also con/ 
ceives of the novel of sentiment and bildung as belonging to a tradition 
which has a specific relationship to heteroglossia. As we have seen in our 
discussion of The Mill on the Floss (sections 3.13), the novel of bildung has 
been capable of representing dialects and forms of demotic speech (the 
speech of the provincial Tullivers and the Dodsons), but it organises them 
into a clear hierarchy, and according to Bakhtin this amounts to an approach 
to heteroglossia from 'above'. In this kind of novel authoritative literary 
language 'descends' upon the variety of voices, dialects and jargons that 
comprise a given culture. 

Novels of the 'second' line of development adopt a different relationship 
to heteroglossia. Bakhtin argues that these narratives approach heteroglossia 
from 'below': 'out of the heteroglot depths they rise to the highest spheres of 
literary language and overwhelm them.' 23 We can see the point he is making 
if we think about texts that we have been reading. Rabelais's prose provides 
the most pointed example: we have seen the way in which the 'billingsgate' 
of the marketplace rises to inhabit and parody a high ecclesiastical genre. 
And in Midnight's Children there is Padma, the common/sensical narratee 
who just wants Saleem to tell his story in a straightforward manner, demand/ 
ing 'what is so precious to demand all this writing/shiting?' (p. 24). In using 
a comic and pretension/crushing language of excrement, Bakhtin would say 
that Padma's voice refuses 'to acknowledge . . . poetic, scholarly or otherwise 
lofty and significant labels' which are always aligned, however subtly, with 
forms of social and political power. 24 

Bakhtin's conception of 'lines of development' has a real but limited 
usefulness; after all, the kinds of narrative that we are looking at in this 
chapter are very good at exposing them as spurious fictions of coherence. It 
is perhaps more useful to think in terms of intertextual borrowings and 
inflections, the point of intersection and recognition being the implied

readers and the 'heteroglossia' that shapes their horizons. Whatever, 
Bakhtin's notion of an approach to 'heteroglossia' from 'below' does help us 
to comprehend a mode of intertextuality which can direct its comic energies 
to oppose the 'scholarly ... lofty and significant labels' which organise the 
cultural practices of colonial domination. However, in arguing this through 
an exploration of the intertextual affiliations between Midnight's Children and 
Tristram Shandy we shall have to negotiate debates at the heart of postcolonial 
criticism. 

5.7 Carnivalised narrative, postcolonialism and the debate 
about 'hybridity': Midnight's Children revisited 

In section 5.4 I cited Vijay Mishra and Bob Hodge, who claimed that the 
'narrative energy' of Midnight's Children derives from the way it incorporates 
Indian cultural concepts such as maya, which relativise Western notions of 
historical time by highlighting their illusory status. Yet the 'narrative energy' 
of Midnight's Children is surely attributable to postmodern Western cultural 
sources as well (see section 5.3). Moreover, in my account of the long cross/ 
cultural history of carnivalised narrative, readers will have noted parallels 
and intertextual affiliations between Tristram Shandy and Rushdie's Midnight's 
Children. Both Tristram and Saleem are preoccupied with time ? both 
narratives begin with clocks ? yet neither is able to keep his digressive 
narrative on course. In a direct echo of Tristram, Padma (the narratee in 
Midnight's Children) urges Saleem to 'get a move on or you'll die before you 
get yourself born' (p. 38). Both narrators are preoccupied with their noses: 
in Tristram's case, his lack of a nose prompts a digression into his father's 
obsession with physiognomical theories of noses. In Saleem's case his huge 
nose as good as names him ('Sniffer') and appears ? falsely ? to indicate his 
descent from his grandfather, Aadam Aziz. Aadam Aziz's powers of smell 
also prompt a narrative digression, leading Saleem to deliver 'a brief paean 
to dung' during his narration of the most stern and murderous assertion of 
English colonial discipline, the Amritsar massacre of 1919 (p. 32). English 
colonial control is cut down to size in its comparison with the lifcaffirming 
'brotherhood of shit' which levels humans and beasts in the city, and which 
can be linked to Rabelaisian bodily humour. 

These rich veins of cross-cultural intertextuality provide us with a 
perspective on a phenomenon that Selden Whitcomb (see Chapter 1) noted 
when he remarked in 1906 that 'there are few great novels which do not 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



49 



Carnivalised narrative, postcolonialism and 'hybridity' 149 

show the influence of more than one nationality', and that, consequently, 
'the history of fiction is largely a study of international relations' (p. 189). 
Whitcomb's observation is borne out by the fact that, during the eighteenth 
century, Samuel Richardson's fictions (see sections 2.7?10) had a powerful 
impact on the development of sentimental and epistolary fiction in France. 
At the end of the nineteenth century, Henry James (see sections 4.5?8) was 
an American who wrote novels about English life which were influenced in 
their method by the experimental techniques of the French novelist Gustave 
Flaubert. We began this chapter by looking at the influence of the French 
Robbe/Grillet on the British John Fowles. And in the long cross-cultural 
history of the carnivalised novel that we have traced in this chapter, we have 
established that Sterne's Tristram Shandy absorbed aspects of a comic French 
tradition through Rabelais's Gargantua and Pantagruel; it also alludes to a 
Spanish tradition through Cervantes's Don Quixote. We have seen how 
Sterne's novel is connected to classical Greek and Latin satiric narratives; 
and how, in turn, Tristram Shandy has been absorbed into Rushdie's novel 
about India, Midnight's Children. This is not to mention the other inter/ 
national affiliations which Midnight's Children registers through its inter/ 
textual echoings of so/called 'magic realist' narratives from different cultures: 
the German Giinter Grass's The Tin Drum (1959), and the Latin American 
Garcia Gabriel Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967). 

But we have to ask what kind of critical enterprise we are involved in 
when extending Whitcomb's claims about the 'internationalism' of fiction 
by drawing attention to the intertextual echoes in Midnight's Children. It is 
important to be aware that artistic transactions between imperial nations 
such as England and France have a somewhat different status to transactions 
between a nation and a colony, even a new nation in the process of 
decolonisation (such as India). Edward Said's thesis on the nature of 
'Orientalism' argues that the imperial European nation states in the 
nineteenth century developed a powerful colonial discourse which shaped 
artistic practices such as novel writing and literary criticism. This discourse 
was rooted in the scholarly and intellectual archives of philology (a 'racial' 
history of language development), lexicography, history, political and 
economic theory, and biology and anthropology. A good example of the 
literary/critical results would be Selden Whitcomb's book. Whitcomb 
thought that the novel 'reflected' the conflicts between races and creeds 
thrown together by empire, but he viewed empire as a 'moral unity' (imply/ 
ing that what it colonised was chaos). Such colonised races and creeds were,

50 



150 History, intertextuality and the carnivalised novel 

for Whitcomb, essential types which could be known and classified accord/ 
ing to a 'semi/scientific spirit' (pp. 134?5). This 'semi/scientific' discourse 
about the East ('the Orient') rendered it, from the point of view of civil/ 
ization and race, inferior to the West ('the Occident'), and was used as a 
form of intellectual domination over colonial subjects. As Said points out, 
novelists such as George Eliot, Charles Dickens and Gustave Flaubert 
shared the assumptions of this discourse, which promulgated the 'indisput/ 
able truth that Occidentals are superior to Orientals'. 25 

The difficulty is that this archive of Orientalist scholarship may continue 
to assert itself unconsciously in the present. As Dipesh Chakrabarty notes, 
when Linda Hutcheon writes on Midnight's Children as a postmodern novel 
she names its Western intertextual sources, such as The Tin Drum and 
Tristram Shandy, whilst simply referring to the nameless 'Indian legends, 
films and literature' which it incorporates. 26 In foregrounding the inter/ 
textual affiliation between Midnight's Children and Tristram Shandy it could 
be argued that I am simply assimilating Rushdie's novel about India to a 
European 'tradition' of novel writing and criticism which is its yardstick, 
the standard to which it must aspire. Am I thereby continuing to participate 
in an Orientalist practice of colonial domination? 

This takes us to a debate in postcolonial criticism which addresses the 
cultural politics of colonialism in general. The debate reflects on, first, the 
relationship between first culture, language and subjectivity; and, secondly, 
practices of colonial domination and the role that the novel and prose 
narrative play in the shaping of colonial subjectivities. On the one hand, 
Ngugi wa Thiong'o, an African writer and intellectual, has started from a 
premise which links an historical materialist politics to the argument which 
proposes that culture is communitarian and coterminous with language. For 
Ngugi, the mode of productive life which has shaped cooperation and com/ 
munication during the course of a community's long history gives rise to a 
sophisticated and distinctive language and, thereby, an equally distinctive 
culture: 'culture is a product of the history which it in turn reflects.' 27 Ngugi 
goes on to argue that under colonial administration, indigenous languages 
are outlawed through the education system: he describes, autobiographically, 
the subjective scars that this inflicts: namely, the profound sense of alienation 
he experienced in leaving his village and its language (Gikuyu), and attend/ 
ing school to learn English, where those who continued to use the language 
of the 'home culture' were punished and humiliated. Ngugi's arguments 
about the relationship between language, culture and subjectivity lead him

51 



Carnivalised narrative, postcolonialism and 'hybridity' 151 

to insist on the imperative facing indigenous writers to write in the language 
of their own people, rather than the language of the coloniser. Ngugi is 
critical of the audience implications of what he calls 'hybrid traditions', that 
is to say writing about a particular colonial experience in the language of the 
coloniser. 28 This is one context for assessing the political and cultural re/ 
lations in which Midnight's Children is embedded: the number of indigenous 
Indian people who have a good command of English is around thirteen 
million ? a large number, yet it amounts to only 2 per cent of the total 
population. 29 

Ngugi sees 'hybrid traditions' as a stage that postcolonial writing must 
pass through before intellectuals start to write in their indiginous languages: 
as we shall see in section 5.8, Ngugi's own career as a writer of the novel of 
colonial experience passed through such a stage. But what if 'hybridity' is 
more than just a stage? It can be argued that Midnight's Children performs and 
dramatises the inescapability of 'hybridity'. Saleem contends that 'things - 
even people ? have a way of leaking into each other' (p. 38). Indeed, the 
concept of hybridity actually constitutes another strategy of postcolonial 
analysis, and Rushdie's novel reflects on this strategy at a number of levels. 
Beginning with character, many people and traditions (Hindu, Muslim, 
Anglo/ French) have, of course, 'leaked' into Saleem to make him what he 
is, a facet of self-knowledge which is performed in his digressive narration. 

Before specifying the other levels, we need to address the conceptual 
coordinates of this strategy. For postcolonial theorists such as Homi K. 
Bhabha, the concept of hybridity articulates the divided condition of 
language, culture and identity. Instead of seeing language, culture and 
identity as rooted in one location, static and imbued with essences, this 
approach acknowledges the divisions, fluid boundaries and diasporic 
mobility which renders them permeable, and leaking all the time. Bakhtin's 
theory of the heteroglot nature of language (see section 5.6) and its impli/ 
cations for the subject have provided points of departure for postcolonial 
critics. 30 Bakhtin argued that the subject can become an object of its own 
perception through preexisting categories that evolve in the discourses of 
social life. Such categories are formed by discourses which are made up of 
the common material of signs, or the currency of 'inner' and 'outer' speech, 
which shape identity while enabling participation in dialogue and social 
interaction. But the signs of a supposedly 'national' language, such as 
English or Russian, are themselves accented in a variety of ways according 
to the social position from which they are articulated. The process of 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



52 



152 History, intertextuality and the carnivalised novel 

dialogue is constantly modifying and inflecting the accents and significance 
of these signs. Magnified, and transported to more radically divergent cross/ 
cultural encounters ? say, English meets Gikuyu, or Urdu meets English ? 
this model enables an understanding of languages, cultures and subjec/ 
tivities in variable hybrid states. From this perspective it is possible to theorise 
colonial situations in which the languages, cultures and identities of colon/ 
ised and colonisers are 'leaking' into one another to effect symbolic and 
psychic shifts against the grain of the presumed structure of power relations. 

Of course, this model can never override the attention we must pay to 
Ngugi's political analysis of the enforced erasure of an indigenous language 
by systematic force through beatings and humiliation in colonial schools. 
But what it can do is to provide Western academic readers with ways 
of interpreting the intertextualities of 'hybrid' fictions such as Midnight's 
Children which use the language and indeed the fictional traditions of the 
West, while yet appropriating these traditions to generate new, carnivalised 
forms of resistance to the colonial structures of thought embodied in Orien/ 
talism and colonial ideologies. 

Clement Hawes provides us with a way of thinking about how Rushdie 
does this, and this is where we bring Tristram Shandy back into the frame. We 
have seen how postcolonial critics such as Mishra and Hodge have objected 
to postmodern readings of Midnight's Children. Hawes is in turn critical of 
postcolonial readings which approach the novel as a 'staged' confrontation 
between Western and Eastern modes of knowledge. Focusing on the way 
in which Midnight's Children allows Tristram Shandy to 'leak' into it, Hawes 
contends that 'Rushdie's novel exemplifies the potential of a more nuanced 
politics of literary affiliation and periodisation ... Rushdie's gesture in 
reaching back to Tristram Shandy can be seen as a fitting strategy of reappro/ 
priating the European past for the emerging political and cultural project of 
postcoloniality.' 31 

How, in Hawes's view, does Rushdie achieve this? Hawes focuses on the 
figure of the nose, which is a feature of both novels. Hawes argues that in 
Tristram Shandy, Sterne's representation of Walter Shandy's obsession with 
noses, character and their relationship to family fortunes is a parody which 
is directed at class/based codes of physiognomical knowledge (for nine/ 
teenth/century manifestations of this see section 3.5). As Hawes points out, 
the parody is made effective through a metafictional reflection on the role 
of narrative in constructing knowledge. Tristram's nose has actually been 
flattened at birth by forceps, but Walter Shandy is convinced that Tristram's 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag 



53 



Conclusion 153 

shortcomings in nasal proportions have been 'caused' by descent from his 
grandfather's own inferior proboscis: Walter Shandy arbitrarily constructs a 
given feature as a 'cause' or origin of something to which it is unrelated. 

Hawes argues that Sterne's eighteenth/century parody of origins is 
appropriated by Rushdie's novel, for it is remarkably similar to the narrative 
of origins and descent that the reader of Midnight's Children is drawn into 
when following the nasal similarities between Saleem and his grandfather, 
Aadam Aziz, before experiencing its metafictional reversal. However, it is 
important to be aware that the metafictional parody works differently in the 
postcolonial context which Rushdie's novel addresses. This is because the 
structures of knowledge and power, which Rushdie's carnivalised humour 
of the body mobilises the reader's laughter against, are themselves different. 
Hawes argues that in allowing Saleem to 'give birth to parents', Midnight's 
Children parodies and refuses the scientific, classificatory theories of racial 
types and essences which became increasingly powerful in the nineteenth 
and twentieth centuries through Orientalist discourses, and such narrative 
forms as the nationalistic historical novel, which frequently represented 
characters fashioned from discourses which defined national and racial 
types. Of course, Hawes is fighting on a Western academic front, but from 
the perspective of an academy which was once at the heart of the production 
of Orientalist scholarly discourse, knowledge and power, this is still signifi/ 
cant. The intertextualities of Midnight's Children can be read as a productive 
and challenging performance of postcolonial 'hybridity'. 

5.8 Conclusion: long live postcolonial realism, 
the bildungsroman ? and leakage 

I began this final chapter by reflecting on the late twentieth/century novel's 
postmodern scepticism about historical knowledge. From the discussion of 
intertextuality that followed, it is clear that, far from seeing no further need 
for history, late twentieth/century novels such as Midnight's Children playfully 
internalise and reinflect both a sense of history and the history of the novel 
in order to issue complex invitations to the reader. In being invited to reflect 
on the experience of colonialism and decolonisation, the implied reader of 
Midnight's Children laughs, puzzles over narrative digressions and reversals, 
and is urged by the novel's intertexts to consider other narrative traditions, 
some perhaps familiar, others perhaps alien: but always to consider them in 
fresh ways.

154 History, intertextuality and the carnivalised novel 

What are the implications of this discussion of the carnivalised novel for 
the history of the novel, and the novel in history? As Bakhtin's insistence on 
two lines of novelistic development should remind us, not all late twentieth/ 
century novels are either metafictional or carnivalised novels (see section 5.6). 
For some writers, the politics of colonialism and decolonisation can still be 
addressed within the frame of the historical novel. For instance, Ngugi wa 
Thiong'o, before taking his stand against the use of the English language in 
his artistic work, made his own contributions to the tradition of the Anglo/ 
African novel: Petals of Blood (1977), which dramatises the process of 
decolonisation in Kenya, is shaped by the form of the European historical 
novel. Indeed, the narrative voice articulates a strong commitment to the 
reconstruction of an authoritative and liberating history of native origins, 
once the partialities of colonial ideologies have been swept aside: 

For there are many questions about our history which remain unanswered. Our 
present day historians, following on similar theories yarned out by defenders of 
imperialism, insist we only arrived here yesterday. Where went all the Kenyan 
people who used to trade with China, India, Arabia long before Vasco da 
Gama came to the scene ...; But even then these adventurers of Portuguese 
mercantalism were forced to build Fort Jesus, showing that Kenyan people had 
always been ready to resist foreign control and exploitation. The story of this 
heroic resistance: who will sing it; 

Ngugi's answer to this question is to find the resistance in a complex narra/ 
tive web which, in a diverse medley of prose genres, weaves the intersecting 
memories and lives of his characters, who centre on the village of Ilmorog. 
The village mediates, and stands as a microcosm for, the developing tensions 
between the urban centres and the localities, both of which, despite decolon/ 
isation, continue to be controlled by international capital. Ngugi's narrative 
is governed by an historical/realist frame. The narrative is shaped by the 
time/space coordinates of national history and territory, and the bildungs/ 
roman or novel of education is an important sub/genre for exploring the 
process of political and personal enlightenment. 33 

Bakhtin saw the bildungsroman as part of the 'first' line of novelistic 
development, and this narrative framework continues to hold appeal for 
contemporary diasporic writers in English such as Hanif Kureishi, albeit 
inflected in new ways. Kureishi's novel The Buddha of Suburbia (1990) is a 
first/person, autobiographical bildungsroman about Karim's hybrid up/ 
bringing in south London, as the son of an Indian father and English 
mother. Like Wilhelm Meister, the subject of Goethe's original bildungs/

55 



Notes 155 

roman, Karim becomes an actor (see section 3.1). Such a contemporary 
novel of formation is complex, given the melting pot of late 1970s cultures, 
identities and conflicts that the narrative traces: the repressions and longings 
for freedom experienced in the suburban family; emigre recollections of 
Bombay and its customs in a grocer's shop under siege from right-wing 
racists; left-wing avant'garde theatre in the city; and the anarchic phenom/ 
enon of punk music. There is a heterogeneity and an inventiveness that are 
emblematic of both the postmodern condition and postcolonial hybridity, 
vested in characters who cast off an old self to appropriate a new version 
which turns out to be a parody: Karim's father, a civil servant, reinvents 
himself as a parody of a Buddhist guru; his uncle Anwar, a shopkeeper, 
reinvents himself as a parody of Ghandi as he goes on hunger strike to 
protest at his daughter's initial refusal to agree to an arranged marriage. 
Karim's progress through this urban and suburban landscape is based on 
a narrative momentum reminiscent of that which we saw in Jane Eyre (see 
Chapter 3). At the end of his story Karim, surrounded by his family at a 
celebratory gathering, narrates in the language of the classical bildungs' 
roman 'about what I'd been through as I'd struggled to locate myself and 
learn what the heart is. Perhaps in the future I would learn to live more 
deeply'. 34 At other times Karim's progress is comic and grotesquely 
Rabelaisian. In a parodic, suburban imitation of the balcony scene in Romeo 
and Juliet, Karim tries to get the attention of his girlfriend whilst bypassing 
her racist father; he fails, is verbally abused by the father, and succeeds 
only in arousing the sexual interest of the family's Great Dane. Thus, in 
Kureishi's hands the tradition of bildung and sentiment is 'leaked' into by 
the comic/grotesque. It is perhaps appropriate that we should conclude this 
study of the novel ? a form which promiscuously defies generic regularity ? 
not with Bakhtin's 'two lines of development' running parallel to one another 
and at arm's length, but instead merging, leaking into one another.

Select bibliography and suggested further reading 



This is not a full bibliography of all the secondary texts referred to in the 
notes, though it does include many of the works cited there. Its purpose is to 
facilitate additional and in some cases more advanced reading and study. For 
reasons of space, entries are restricted to general works about the novel, prose 
narrative, and related critical themes and movements. 

General guides to the novel 

General histories and evaluations of the English novel can be found 
in Walter Allen, The English Novel (London: Phoenix House, 1954), and 
Arnold Kettle, An Introduction to the English Novel, 2 volumes (London: 
Hutchinson, 1951). Kettle's work continues to offer valuable insights. 
Jeremy Hawthorn's Studying the Novel (London: Arnold, 1985) remains an 
excellent introductory work. Lennard J. Davis, Resisting Novels: Ideology and 
Fiction (London: Methuen, 1987), offers a more challenging introduction to 
the novel which looks at the basic elements of the novel ? location, character, 
narrator, reader, plot ? from the perspective of theories of ideology. 



Literary theory: general guides 

Perhaps the most accessible introduction to the main positions and 'schools' 
comprising literary theory is Terry Eagleton, Literary Theory: An Introduction, 
2nd edition (Oxford: Blackwell, 1996). A helpful general introduction to 
reading through theory can be found in Raman Selden, Practising Theory and 
Reading Literature: An Introduction (Hemel Hempstead: Harvester Wheat/ 
sheaf, 1989); another good introduction to reading through theory is Julian 
Wolfreys and William Baker (eds), Literary Theories: A Case Study in Critical

Performance (London: Macmillan, 1996), which has the advantage of using 
a variety of critical approaches to read the same short narrative (by Richard 
Jefferies). Stuart Sim (ed.), The A\Z Guide to Modem Critical and Cultural 
Theorists (Hemel Hempstead: Harveter Wheatsheaf, 1995), contains brief 
introductory essays on major theorists. Michael Payne (ed.), A Dictionary 
of Cultural and Critical Theory (Oxford: Blackwell, 1996), provides entries 
on movements and concepts as well as theorists. There are two useful 
anthologies on the New Historicism which provide more detailed and 
nuanced accounts of the movement. They are Kiernan Ryan (ed.), New 
Historicism and Cultural Materialism: A Reader (London: Arnold, 1996), and 
H. Aram Veeser (ed.), The New Historicism Reader (London: Routledge, 
1994). Both anthologies reprint representative pieces of criticism; the 
Ryan is particularly useful because it provides extracts from the 'founding' 
theoretical positions which have contributed to New Historicism and 
cultural materialism ? though there is nothing from the important works of 
Mikhail Bakhtin. Pam Morris (ed.) has assembled a valuable selection from 
Bakhtin's writings in The Bakhtin Reader (London: Arnold, 1994), framed 
by good commentaries. The same can be said for Simon Dentith (ed.), 
Bakhtinian Thought: An Introductory Reader (London: Routledge, 1995). 

Approaches to narrative practice: general 

Erich Auerbach's Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature, 
1946 (translated into English in 1953 by Willard R. Trask) (Princeton, NJ: 
Princeton University Press) is an ambitious and wide-ranging work which 
embraces writings from Homer to James Joyce; essential reading for under/ 
standing 'realist' narrative conventions and their relations to the 'everyday' as 
well as the tragic. Cleanth Brooks and Robert Penn Warren, Understanding 
Fiction (New York: Appleton/Century/Crofts, 1943), was an important 
guide to the study of fictional and non/fictional narrative which under/ 
pinned the American New Critical tradition, an approach emphasising 
form and artistic autonomy. For a rhetorical approach to narrative see Wayne 
C. Booth, The Rhetoric of Fiction (Chicago and London: University of 
Chicago Press, 1961). Seymour Chatman, Story and Discourse: Narrative 
Structure in Fiction and Film, 1978 (Ithaca, NY, and London: Cornell 
University Press, 1993), and Shlomith Rimmon/Kenan, Narrative Fiction: 
Contemporary Poetics, New Accents (London: Methuen, 1983) are compre/ 
hensive and accessible books which synthesise some of the most demanding

work on structuralist narratology, including Gerard Genette's influential 
Narrative Discourse, 1972 (translated into English in 1980). Ian Reid's 
Narrative Exchange (London: Routledge, 1992) is a challenging work which 
uses poststructuralist and linguistic theories to go beyond the categories of 
narratology, especially the category of the 'event'. 

The rise of the novel 

The best/known contributors to this debate are Ian Watt's The Rise of the 
Novel: Studies in Defoe, Richardson and Fielding, 1957 (London: Hogarth 
Press, 1987), Lennard J. Davis's Factual Fictions: The Origins of the English 
Novel (New York: Columbia University Press, 1983), Michael McKeon's 
The Origins of the English Novel 1600-1740 (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins 
University Press, 1987), and Nancy Armstrong's Desire and Domestic 
Fiction: A Political History of the Novel (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 
1987). All are substantially discussed (with full citation) in Chapter 2. It is 
important here to highlight the revisionary feminist work of Jane Spencer, 
The Rise of the Woman Novelist (1986), and Ros Ballaster's Seductive Forms: 
Women's Amatory Fiction from 1684 to 1740 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1992). 

The most recent and boldly revisionary contribution to the debate 
is Margaret Anne Doody's The True Story of the Novel, 1997 (London: 
Fontana, 1998); it refutes the critical orthodoxy which holds the novel to be 
an exclusively Western European phenomenon of fairly recent origins. 
Doody has instead focused on the popular 'romance' narratives of classical 
Graeco'Roman culture, which have tended to be regarded as unworthy 
forerunners of the novel. Doody makes a powerful case for these narratives 
of the classical age as sophisticated precursors of the modern novel, on 
which their modern descendants continue to draw. Doody emphasises the 
complex hybrid origins of these classical narratives by tracing African and 
Eastern influences: her account of the rise of the novel is shaped by both 
postcolonial and feminist concerns. 

Postcolonial orientations have broadened perspectives on the question of 
the origins of the novel. For instance, Nancy Armstrong and Leonard 
Tennenhouse argue that, in addition to originating in English conduct 
manuals, Pamela suggests affinities with colonial American 'captivity 
narratives' (Puritan confessional narratives by settler women who had been 
captured by native Americans) which were being exported across the 
Atlantic to England in the later seventeenth century; 'The American

Origins of the English Novel', American Literary History 4:3 (fall 1992), 
386?410. Turning to a Marxist theorist who is critical of certain positions in 
postcolonial theory, Aijaz Ahmed's 'Jameson's Rhetoric of Otherness and 
the "National Allegory" in In Theory: Classes, Nations, Literatures (London: 
Verso, 1992) conducts an argument against Frederic Jameson's theory of the 
Third World novel as 'National Allegory', and in doing so offers a 
fascinating account of the rise of the Urdu domestic/realist novel as an 
important facet of an emergent indigenous print culture and civil society in 
nineteenth/century colonial India. Ahmed's perspective ? which draws out 
the liberatory energies of such publishing practices ? offers a counterpoint 
to Nancy Armstrong's work on the function of the domestic novel in 
England. 

The work of Raymond Williams initiated an early British exploration of 
the relationship between the rise of the novel, literacy, and the struggle to 
develop a democratic culture. The Long Revolution (London: Chatto and 
Windus, 1961) accounts for the relationship between the development of 
literacy, cultural forms and political institutions in England from the late 
eighteenth century to the present. Williams published The English Novel from 
Dickens to Lawrence in 1970 (London: Chatto and Windus). This work 
follows from, and is a revision of, Leavis's somewhat reactionary account of 
the same network of relations. Leavis's influential work on the English 
novel, The Great Tradition, was published in 1948 (London: Chatto and 
Windus). Richard D. Altick's history of popular reading trends in 
England, The English Common Reader: A Social History of the Mas S' Reading 
Public (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1957), remains 
an important source of reference. 

Prose narrative (biography, autobiography) 

Roger Pooley's English Prose of the Seventeenth Century, 1590?1700 (London: 
Longman, 1992) contains valuable chapters on Elizabethan fiction, 
biography and the spiritual autobiography, as well as important seventeenth/ 
century prose forms such as the sermon. Elspeth Graham, Hilary Hinds, 
Elaine Hobby and Helen Wilcox have edited Her Own Life: Autobiographical 
Writings by Seventeenth' Century English Women (London: Routledge, 1989). 
This is a collection of primary texts, and the editors have written a valuable 
introduction outlining contexts for reading these writings, as well as 
reflections on the theory of autobiography in relation to the concept of the

gendered self. Felicity Nussbaum's The Autobiographical Subject: Gender and 
Ideology in Eighteenth' Century England (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University 
Press, 1989) explores the gender of autobiographical discourse in eighteenth/ 
century England. George P. Landow (ed.), Approaches to Victorian Auto' 
biography (Athens, OH: Ohio University Press, 1979), contains a variety of 
useful essays. Reginia Gagnier's Subjectivities : A History of Self' Representation 
in Britain, 1832-1920 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990) explores 
the shared and divergent conventions that writers of different genders and 
from different classes used to represent themselves in the nineteenth century. 
David Vincent's Bread, Knowledge and Freedom: A Study of Working Class 
Autobiography (London: Methuen, 1981) is a ground-breaking study of 
working/class autobiography in the nineteenth century. Carol Jenkins 
addresses a gap in Vincent's work in 'The Major Silence: Autobiographies 
of Working Women in the Nineteenth Century' in J. B. Bullen (ed.), 
Writing and Victorianism (London: Longman, 1997). Ira Bruce Nadel's 
Biography: Fiction, Fact and Form (London: Macmillan, 1985) contains some 
valuable chapters on the similarities between biography and fiction, and 
biography as a literary and cultural institution. The latter theme is pursued 
further in David Amigoni's Victorian Biography: Intellectuals and the Ordering 
of Discourse (Hemel Hempstead: Harvester Wheatsheaf, 1993). Trev Lynn 
Broughton's Men of Letters, Writing Lines: Masculinity and Literary Auto' 
biography in the Late Victorian Period (London: Routledge, 1999) makes 
valuable links between autobiographical and biographical genres, gender 
and the workings of late nineteenth/century literary culture. For a per/ 
spective on women and autobiography in the twentieth century see Linda 
Anderson's Women and Autobiography in the Twentieth Century: Remembered 
Futures (Hemel Hempstead: Harvester, 1996). 

Eighteenth/century and Romantic period fiction 

Frederick Karl's A Reader's Guide to the Development of the English Novel in 
the Eighteenth Century, 1974 (London: Thames and Hudson, 1975) is a 
detailed, readable and highly informative guide to the major eighteenth/ 
century novelists. Clive T Probyn's English Fiction of the Eighteenth Century 
(London: Longman, 1987) covers similar ground and can be seen, in a 
sense, as an alternative to the discourse/system explanations of origins 
by critics such as Lennard J. Davis and Michael McKeon (see 'The rise of 
the novel' above): for Probyn 'the novel is the most recalcitrant of forms,

resisting all attempts to follow any single development' (p. 12). John J. 
Richetti (ed.), The Cambridge Companion to the Eighteenth' Century Novel 
(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), contains a number of 
valuable essays on major themes and individual novelists, including 
Margaret Doody on Richardson. Gary Kelly's English Fiction of the Romantic 
Period 1 789-1830 (London: Longman, 1989) is probably the definitive study 
of this period: it includes probing chapters on Sir Walter Scott and Jane 
Austen; the chapter on Austen situates her writing in the context of other 
fictional trends in the period. Kate Ferguson Ellis's The Contested Castle: 
Gothic Novels and the Subversion of Gender Ideology (Urbana: University of 
Illinois Press, 1989) is a study of the gothic movement and its relations to 
gender ideology. E. J. Clery's The Rise of Supernatural Fiction 1762?1800 
(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995) is a highly original study 
of gothic fiction as a site of convergence for the struggles which surrounded 
discourses of the supernatural and commerce in the later eighteenth century. 

Nineteenth/century fiction 

Michael Wheeler's English Fiction of the Victorian Period, 1830?1890 (London: 
Longman, 1985) is a useful survey which provides accounts of the major 
trends in Victorian fiction. In addition to contributing to the debate about 
the rise of the novel, Nancy Armstrong's Desire and Domestic Fiction: A 
Political History of the Novel extends her account of the gender politics of 
domestic discourse into a reading of the English nineteenth/century novel, 
particularly novels published around 1848. Mary Poovey's Uneven Develop' 
merits: The Ideological Work of Gender in Mid' Victorian England (Chicago and 
London: University of Chicago Press, 1988) extends this feminist work on 
the relationship between the novel and gendered discourses. 

Catherine Gallagher has produced a major work of New Historicist 
scholarship in The Industrial Reformation of English Fiction: Social Discourse 
and Narrative Form (Chicago and London: University of California Press, 
1985). Gallagher's work constructs relations between discourses of social 
and industrial reform and the narrative strategies employed by Victorian 
novelists. A similar approach is adopted by Mary Poovey's more recent 
Making a Social Body: British Cultural Formation 1830?1864 (Chicago and 
London: Chicago University Press, 1995). Poovey's account reconstructs a 
pervasive discourse of the body which was common to the great documents 
of sanitary reform and social management, and the novels of Disraeli,

Dickens and Gaskell. D.A. Miller's The Novel and the Police (Berkeley, 
CA, and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1987) is another 
influential New Historicist approach to the nineteenth/century novel, which 
takes its lead from the work of Michel Foucault. Miller's work contends 
that the novel is a form of discourse which 'polices' subjectivity: though 
his readings of the mechanisms and strategies by which such processes are 
performed stress sophistication and complexity. Jenny Bourne Taylor and 
Sally Shuttleworth's Embodied Selves: An Anthology of Psychological Texts 
1830?1890 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998) assembles a rich selection of 
hitherto inaccessible material, which provides the means for making 
connections between nineteenth/century theories of psychological moral 
management and narrative strategies in a wide range of Victorian texts, 
especially sensation fiction. An exemplary study is Jenny Bourne Taylor's In 
the Secret Theatre of the Home: Wilkie Collins, Sensation Narrative and Nineteenth-' 
Century Psychology (London: Routledge, 1988). For a more general intro 
duction, see Lyn Pykett, The Sensation Novel, Writers and their Work 
(London: Northcote House, 1994). 

Transitional and Modernist fiction 

Peter Keating's The Haunted Study: A Social History of the English Novel 
1875-1914, 1989 (London: Fontana, 1991) is an essential starting point, and 
is particularly good on the social history of publishing and reading trends. 
Clare Hanson's Short Stories and Short Fictions: 1880?1980 (London: 
Macmillan, 1985) offers an account of the development of the short story 
form in the period. Dominic Head's The Modernist Short Story: A Study in 
Theory and Practice (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992) is more 
theoretically challenging and focuses on the Modernist short story. David 
Trotter's The English Novel in History, 1895-1920 (London: Routledge, 1993) 
is a widcranging examination of high Modernist and popular fictions 
(such as the detective and imperial adventure novels); it is also a revisionary 
reading of Modernist stylistics. Lyn Pykett 's Engendering Fictions: The English 
Novel in the Early Twentieth Century (London: Arnold, 1995) is a feminist 
reading of developments in the early twentieth/century novel centred on 
gender ideology and late nineteenth/century theories of degeneration. 
Randall Stevenson's Modernist Fiction: An Introduction (Hemel Hempstead: 
Harvester Wheatsheaf, 1992) examines Modernist narrative practice in 
relation to historical shifts in perceptions of time, space and value: 



02 pages 001-172 29/1/03 17:27 Pag

Stevenson's account is influenced by Bakhtin. Malcolm Bradbury and 
James McFarlane (eds), Modernism, 1890?1930 (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 
1976), situates Modernism in a wider European context, and contains essays 
on fiction. Vassiliki Kolocotroni, Jane Goldman and Olga Taxidou (eds) 
have produced a wonderful resource in Modernism: An Anthology of Sources 
and Documents (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998). It contains 
much of relevance for the study of fiction. Patricia Waugh's Practising 
Postmodernism, Reading Modernism (London: Arnold, 1992) provides a 
postmodern approach to the reading of Modernist fiction which is premised 
on the argument that there is no substantial aesthetic break between 
Modernist and postmodernist narrative practice. 

Metafiction and postmodern fiction 

Steven Connor, The English Novel in History, 1950 to the Present, (London: 
Routledge, 1995), surveys the post/war period. Patricia Waugh's Metafiction: 
The Theory and Practice of Self' Conscious Fiction (London: Methuen, 1984) 
is an excellent introduction to the many facets of self-conscious narrative. 
Patricia Waugh goes on to chart debates within postmodernism in her Post' 
modernism: A Reader (London: Arnold, 1992). Thomas Docherty provides 
similar but perhaps wider/ranging guidance in his Postmodernism: A Reader 
(Hemel Hempstead: Harvester Wheatsheaf, 1993), which assembles a 
range of writings on topics as diverse as fiction and architecture. Major 
studies of postmodern fiction can be found in Brian McHale's Postmodernist 
Fiction (London: Methuen, 1987) and in Linda Hutcheon's A Poetics of 
Postmodernism: History, Theory, Fiction (London: Routledge, 1988), in which 
Hutcheon coins the concept of 'historiographic metafiction'. The relation/ 
ship between postmodernism and postcolonialism is explored in Ian Adam 
and Helen Tiffin (eds), Past the Last Post: Theorising Post Colonialism and Post 
Modernism (Hemel Hempstead: Harvester Wheatsheaf, 1991). 

Postcolonialism 

Edward Said's Orientalism (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978) is 
the important starting point. His Culture and Imperialism (London: Chatto 
and Windus, 1993) updates and expands his thesis. There is a (slightly 
unfair) tendency now to regard Said's early theory of Orientalist discourse 
as 'monolithic' in the claims that it makes about the West's scholarly and

intellectual will to power over the East. This is reflected in the title of Bill 
Ashcroft, Gareth Griffiths and Helen Tiffin's joint work, The Empire Writes 
Back: Theory and Practice in PosUColonial Literatures (London: Routledge, 
1989) a useful introduction to the field of postcolonial literary studies which 
draws many of its examples from novels and fictions. However, Vijay 
Mishra and Bob Hodge in their essay 'What is Post(')Colonialism?' have 
asked whether postcolonial criticism of the kind performed by Ashcroft, 
Griffiths and Tiffin perhaps places too heavy a reliance on the presumed 
'subversiveness' of the heteroglot novel (p. 280). Their essay can be found in 
Patrick Williams and Laura Chrisman (eds), Colonial Discourse and Post' 
Colonial Theory (Hemel Hempstead: Harvester Wheatsheaf, 1993), along 
with a rich variety of sources which map the major critical and intellectual 
directions in the field. Homi K. Bhabha (ed.), Nation and Narration (Lon/ 
don: Routledge, 1990), contains many valuable essays on the relationship 
between narration and 'location'. Bhabha is one of the leading post/ 
colonialist theorists and critics; his challenging work on subjectivity, 
mimicry and diasporic movement is exemplified in his The Location of 
Culture (London: Routledge, 1994). Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak is 
another major voice in postcolonial theory: an overview of her challenging 
corpus can be found in Donna Lendry and Gerald McLean (eds), The 
Spivak Reader: Selected Works of Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak (New York: 
Routledge, 1995).
